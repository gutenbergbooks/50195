<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The very extensive sale of Practical
Etiquette, a sale that has required the issuance
of a large number of editions of the
little manual, has been very gratifying to
its author, as was also the commission of its
publisher to re-write and enlarge the work.
This commission, however, brought with it
a keen sense of responsibility, for the author
feels that a new work on etiquette can find
a <i>raison d’être</i> only in a fairly successful
attempt at answering practically every question
that can arise concerning social relations,
at least in ordinary social life. But
to speak with authority on all matters of
“good form” is to speak dogmatically, and
so to speak is in itself not good form.
Nevertheless, and in spite of this dilemma,
the author has attempted herein to
decide, when compelled to do so, between
conflicting opinions in mere matters of
social custom, and has given as authority
the opinion that seemed to her to conform
most nearly to common sense, embodying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
such opinion in an unqualified statement
without citing authority. Fortunately,
social customs are now so nearly uniform in
all parts of the country, that one familiar
with the ways of good society in the West
or in the North, is at home in good society
in the East or in the South.</p>

<p>The author is under obligation to so
many persons for suggestions and advice,
as well as to many authors, that it does not
seem best to give a list of the same, especially
as such list could be only a partial one, for
many of her friends would not desire mention
of their names.</p>

<div class="verse">“True politeness is to do and say</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The kindest thing in the kindest way.”</span></div>
</div></div>


<p>If civil law is the outgrowth of regard for
other people’s rights, social law is equally
the outgrowth of regard for other people’s
feelings and convenience. Social law is
kindness and good-will and the desire to be
agreeable codified. A system of so much
importance cannot be unworthy of consideration.</p>

<p>The very essence of good manners is self-possession,
and self-possession is another
name for self-forgetfulness. Gentility is
neither in birth, manner, nor fashion, but in
the mind. A high sense of honor, a determination
never to take a mean advantage
of another, and an adherence to truth,
delicacy, and politeness towards those with
whom one may have dealings, are the essential
and distinguishing characteristics of a
gentleman.</p>

<p>Quietness in all things is an essential
element to a well-bred person. He shuns
all outward display of his personality; he
cares not to be seen or heard; he eschews
noisy and grandiloquent talk; he avoids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
showy and noticeable costumes. His voice
is low; his words simple; and his actions
grave. He holds himself habitually under
restraint; his words never seem to vibrate
with emotion.</p>

<p>Habits are said to be good or bad as
the result of actions that are right or wrong.
A man of good habits is one who has for so
long a time practiced right thinking, speaking,
and doing, that he acts properly from
force of habit.</p>

<p>Good manners are not to be put on for
particular occasions, like fine clothes, but
they should be one’s second nature. The
simpler and more easy and unconstrained
one’s manners, the more he will impress
people with his good breeding. Affectation
is one of the brazen marks of vulgarity.</p>

<p>“A beautiful behavior gives a higher pleasure

the fine arts.”—<i>Emerson.</i></p></div>


<h3>INTRODUCTIONS.</h3>

<p>In introducing persons, one should be
careful to pronounce each name distinctly.</p>

<p>When either name is not perfectly understood,
a repetition of it should be requested
of the person making the introduction.
When introductions are given, it is the man
who should be presented to the woman;
when two women are introduced, it is the
younger who is presented to the elder. For
example, in presenting Mr. Jones to Mrs.
Smith, it is Mrs. Smith’s name that is first
mentioned. The word “introduce” is preferred
to “present.” Informal introductions
are given by merely mentioning the names;
as, “Mrs. Smith, Mr. Jones,” and this is
ordinarily sufficient.</p>

<p>In introducing two sisters, the elder is
“Miss Smith” and the younger “Miss Virginia
Smith.”</p>

<p>When two women are introduced to each
other, it is not necessary for either to rise;
a bow and a smile from each is sufficient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>A woman does not rise when a man is
presented to her, unless he is very old or is
a person of great importance. Upon being
introduced, a married woman may offer her
hand to a man but it is not customary for a
young woman to do so.</p>

<p>It is the duty of a man who attends a
private entertainment, to have himself presented
to every member of the family whom
he does not know.</p>

<p>An introduction in the street car is very
bad form.</p>

<p>One should never forget that it is difficult,
almost impossible, for some people to
remember names and faces, and that such
people actually suffer from their inability to
recognize and call by name persons to whom
they may have been introduced recently.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon to see one approach
such a person, offer her hand, and say, if
there is not an immediate recognition, “I am
afraid you do not remember me,” while the
person approached stands in agony, and
gradually makes an apology for her poor
memory, and asks the name.</p>

<p>One who is truly polite, who is at all
thoughtful for another person’s feelings,
would not be the cause of such a scene.
She would prevent it by saying: “I am
Mrs. Smith. I had the pleasure of meeting
you at Mrs. Brown’s luncheon last
Thursday;” or something of the kind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Whenever one has reason to think his
name or face may have been forgotten, he
should make himself known, in approaching
another person, by giving his name at least.</p>


<h3>CALLS.</h3>

<p>A first call ought to be returned within a
very short time.</p>

<p>A lady when receiving rises as her callers
enter, and they immediately advance to pay
their respects to her before speaking to
others.</p>

<p>A man takes any vacant chair, without
troubling the hostess to look after him.</p>

<p>A man rises when women with whom he
is talking rise to take their leave. Women
calling do not rise unless those who are
leaving are friends older than themselves.</p>

<p>When taking leave, one ought to choose
a moment when there is a lull in the conversation,
and then take leave of the hostess,
letting one bow include the others in the
room.</p>

<p>One month after the birth of a child, a
call of congratulation is made by acquaintances.</p>

<p>A call of condolence is made within ten
days after the death, if the caller is on intimate
terms with the family, or within a
month if otherwise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Calls of congratulation are due to the
newly married, and to the parents who gave
the invitations to the marriage.</p>

<p>A man invited by a woman to call upon
her, cannot, without great discourtesy, neglect
to pay the call within a week.</p>

<p>A lady will never keep a caller waiting,
without sending word that she will be in
immediately.</p>

<p>One ought always to return a call, but if
the acquaintance is not desirable, the first
call may be the last.</p>

<p>Some women only rise when their callers
leave, others accompany them as far as the
drawing-room door; but it is always polite
for a hostess to accompany her visitors to
the front door when they take their leave,
if there is not a servant on hand to open the
door for them. The best bred hostesses
even go so far as to accompany their callers
to the elevator in a hotel or an apartment-house.
Of course, if one has more than one
caller at a time, it would be discourteous to
leave the others to accompany one to the
door; but, otherwise, it is rude to permit
a friend to go to the door alone, and get out
as best she may.</p>

<p>A bride who is “At Home after November
first,” should make a point of literally
staying at home for an hour or two every
afternoon during the month of November<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and the early part of December. She should
be dressed to receive callers, and should
have some dainty refreshments ready to
serve,—tea and sandwiches or cake. After
the first week of December the bride may
begin to return her calls, calling first on
those who first called upon her, and so on.</p>

<p>When the “at home” is a large and formal
function, with engraved invitations and all
the accessories of hired waiters, an elaborate
repast, floral decorations, etc.,—such as a
debutante’s coming out, a wedding reception,
or a reception to celebrate a wedding anniversary,
and other large entertainments of
this order,—an after-call is obligatory. But
an ordinary “at home” does not demand
another call, for instance, the reception or
“days” a bride has on her return from her
wedding trip, or when she is settled in her
new home; or a tea or “days” for which a
hostess informally sends the invitations
written or engraved on her visiting cards,
and receives with little ceremony and serves
only a modest menu. On the contrary, the
hostess owes a return call to all who attend;
and only those who were invited, but were
unable to be present, are in debt to her.</p>

<p>The length of time proper for one to stay
at an “at home” depends on circumstances.
It is always a compliment to one’s hostess
to make a long visit at “a day”, for it implies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
that one is having a pleasant time; but
nobody should stay long enough to be a
burden on the hostess’s hospitality, or to
detain her from her other guests. If one
finds that she does not know any one present,
or if she is not introduced to a congenial
person with whom she can have a pleasant
chat, it would be wise for her to leave after
a conventional ten or fifteen minutes’ call.</p>

<p>The calling code demands that soon after
a second caller is announced, the caller who
was first present shall take leave of the
hostess. The reason for this rule is obvious:
visitor number one has already had a little
time of uninterrupted <i>tête-à-tête</i> with the
hostess before visitor number two appeared,
and he or she should generously retire first,
so that visitor number two may have the
same privilege. But while this is the law,
it depends somewhat on circumstances
whether it is always carried out. If the
first caller is an intimate friend of the
hostess, and has come to have a long informal
talk with her, and the second caller
is merely a formal visitor whose obvious
intention is to make a ceremonious visit,
then the first comer may, with perfect propriety,
outstay the other; or if the hostess
has particularly asked the former to remain
until after the latter goes, he may do so,
and, of course, if the first visitor has come
for some special reason, and the visitor who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
is announced later interrupts an important
conversation, which, for business or other
reasons, should be continued, the former is
naturally justified in transgressing the calling
code. All things being equal, however,
it is the place of the first comer to be the
first goer; and one must have a very good
excuse for outstaying a caller who comes
later.</p>

<p>Guests who are invited to attend one large
reception which is given for the express purpose
of introducing a young woman into
society, should make a call after the reception,
but if the <i>débutante</i> is introduced at a
series of “days,” the callers need call but
once, on one of the “days.”</p>

<p>An invitation to any kind of “day” or
reception demands a card from a person
who is unable to attend the function; and
the card should be sent on the day of the
reception, even if the invitation to the function
has been already answered, and even if
an after-call is in order.</p>

<p>When one calls on an acquaintance who
is staying with a relative, the caller should
ask for the latter (the hostess), even if she
does not know her, and she should leave
one of her own and one of her husband’s
cards for her, as well as one of each for her
friend. It is not obligatory to leave two
of her husband’s cards for each woman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Even in the most formal visiting, it is optional
whether one leaves one or two cards.
Probably the hostess will excuse herself
altogether; but the caller must show her
the courtesy of asking for her.</p>

<p>In making a call it is proper to give one’s
card to the servant who opens the door, if
it is not a regular reception day; but on
such an occasion the card should be left
either in the dressing-room or on the hall
table in passing out.</p>

<p>In making a formal call ten minutes is
quite long enough to stay.</p>

<p>When one is returning visits and driving,
it would be in very bad taste to have the
coachman get off his box and take the card
to the door. It is the woman’s place to deliver
her card in person, unless she has a
footman to attend to it for her.</p>

<p>In making an evening call a man should
appear about half-past eight, and remain an
hour. Even if his visit is to the daughter,
he should ask for her mother.</p>

<p>It is quite proper, when making calls
with a friend, for one to write her name in
pencil on her friend’s card, if she has no
card of her own with her.</p>

<p>Those women whose households are most
modest find that the day “at home” is a
great convenience, since, having a special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
time for receiving one’s friends, all necessary
arrangements can be made beforehand,
and no embarrassing situations are apt to
occur.</p>

<p>When one calls on a friend who lives in a
flat, she should, immediately after ringing,
call through the tube her name and that of
the person she wishes to see.</p>

<p>A man leaves his overcoat, hat, and stick
in the hall when making an evening call;
when calling in the afternoon he leaves his
overcoat in the hall, but carries his hat and
stick into the drawing-room with him.</p>

<p>When a daughter is in the parlor, and
her mother is entertaining callers, she should
rise when her mother does in bidding them
good-day.</p>

<p>It is very improper for a young girl who
is ill to receive men callers in her room.</p>


<h3>CARDS.</h3>

<p>When an invitation to a reception is sent
in the name of several women, a guest
should leave or send cards for all whose
names are on the invitation. A woman
leaves with her own cards the cards of
those members of her family who are unable
to call.</p>

<p>A young woman, when calling upon her
friends with a young man who is a stranger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to them, should send his card with her own
to the hostess and other women of the
household.</p>

<p>In making formal calls a visitor invariably
hands her cards to the servant who
opens the door with a card tray in her
hand; when calling informally one may simply
give her name to the servant at the
door, but then leaves no card later.</p>

<p>A married woman, when making formal
calls, leaves one of her husband’s and one
of her own cards for the hostess and for
every other woman she asks for in the
house, and one of her husband’s cards, besides,
for the host; but, while this is the
rule for formal visiting, it is quite permissible
for a married woman, when calling on
a number of women who reside in the same
house, to leave, besides her own and her
husband’s for the host and hostess, only one
more of each for all the others.</p>

<p>In making formal visits, and subsequent
calls after the first formal visit has been
made, a married woman need leave only one
of her husband’s cards with her own; and
in making a call in acknowledgment of an
invitation to an entertainment to which she
alone was invited,—such as a woman’s luncheon,—she
should leave only one of her own.</p>

<p>The fashionable visiting card varies in
size; but for a married woman it is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
pure white and very thin, with the name
engraved in ordinary script. For a woman
who lives in the country, it is in good taste
to have the name of her country place put
just where, if she were in the city, her town
address would be, which is in the left hand
lower corner.</p>

<p>If a woman receives “at home” cards for
“Tuesdays in February,” and is prevented
from calling on any of the Tuesdays, she
should send her card in an envelope, either
by hand or mail, on the first Tuesday, and
call on the hostess at the earliest opportunity
on some other day.</p>

<p>A man should use a card engraved, as
“Mr. George Wellington Smith,” not
omitting the prefix, with the address in one
corner, if desired. The size of the card
varies from time to time, but it is smaller
than a woman’s card.</p>

<p>The names of mother and daughter or
daughters are often engraved on one card; as,</p>

<div class="bbox2">
<div class="center"><br />
<small>MRS. JUDSON BROWN.<br />
MISS ANNA BROWN.</small><br /><br />
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<div class="bbox2">
<div class="center"><br />
<small>MRS. JUDSON BROWN.<br />
THE MISSES BROWN.</small><br />
<br />
</div>
</div>

<p>The following is the usual form for an
unmarried woman’s card:</p>

<div class="bbox2">
<div class="center"><br />
<small>MISS MAY BROWN,</small></div>
<br />
<small>12 PINE ST.</small><br />
<br />
</div>
</div>

<p>It is quite proper for a woman to retain
her deceased husband’s name on her visiting
cards; as, “Mrs. John Smith.” It is equally
proper for her to use “Mrs. Jane Smith”
for the purpose.</p>

<p>When a caller is met by the hostess at
the door, she should drop her card in the
card receiver or leave it on the hall table on
her way out. The object of such a card is
not to introduce people when visiting, but
as a reminder of the visit.</p>

<p>“P. P. C.” cards should be left on the
occasion of a long absence (of over three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
months); on leaving town at the close of the
season; on leaving a neighborhood where
one has resided for years, or where one has
resided for months and sometimes only for
weeks, but not when changing houses in the
same neighborhood, not even when about
to be married, unless one’s future home is
to be in another city. The words <i>pour
prendre congé</i> signify to take leave.</p>

<p>“R. S. V. P.” means “<i>Repondez s’il vous
plait</i>,” which is the French for “Answer,
if you please.”</p>

<p>Turning down the corner of a visiting
card, meaning that the call was made in
person, is no longer in vogue. One might
leave her card in person, writing on it
“With kind inquiries,” when sickness or
death has entered the household of a friend,
and thus show a delicate courtesy.</p>

<p>It is proper for a hostess to shake hands
with a man visitor on his arrival and at his
departure.</p>

<p>It is an evidence of very bad taste for a
young woman to send wedding cards to a
married man without including his wife’s
name, even if she has no acquaintance whatever
with her.</p>

<p>A young girl who is not “out” does not
have visiting cards. If she is the oldest or
only daughter and is in society, her cards
have upon them “Miss Smith.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>A woman should never ask a man formally
calling to take his hat, or a woman to
lay aside her wraps.</p>

<p>A card sent to an afternoon reception
represents one’s self. It should be sent
either by mail or messenger, and never by a
friend to deposit upon the receiver with her
own card.</p>


<h3>VISITING.</h3>

<p>A guest should always ascertain what are
the usual hours of rising, taking meals, and
retiring, and then conform scrupulously to
them.</p>

<p>Guests should give as little trouble as
possible, and never apologize for the extra
trouble their visit necessarily occasions.</p>

<p>If a ride, drive, or walk is proposed by
one of the family entertaining, a guest
should acquiesce as far as her strength will
allow, and do all in her power to seem
pleased by the efforts made for her entertainment.</p>

<p>Upon taking one’s departure, it is expected—and
reasonably, too—that some
acknowledgment be made of the pleasure
that has been afforded one.</p>

<p>It is also proper upon returning home to
inform the friends just left of one’s safe
arrival.</p>

<p>“Politeness is one of those advantages
which we never estimate rightly, but by the
inconvenience of its loss.”—<i>Samuel Johnson.</i></p></div>


<h3>NOTES OF INVITATION.</h3>

<p>Notes of invitation for evening parties
are issued in the name of the lady of the
house; as,</p>

<p><i>Mrs. James Little requests the pleasure of
Mr. and Mrs. George White’s company on
Monday evening, March seventeenth, from
nine to twelve o’clock.</i><a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>The expression “presents compliments” is
obsolete, as is also the term “polite,” which
was formerly used in acceptances or regrets.
The English form of “kind” or “very
kind” is now substituted in its place.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p>A very acceptable form of invitation for a
mother (if the mother is not living, the
father’s name may be so used) and daughter
is this:</p>

<p><i>Mrs. and Miss Graves at Home, Thursday,
October twenty-seventh, from eight to
eleven o’clock.</i></p>

<p>When a very large dinner party is to
be given, the invitations should be issued
at least two weeks in advance; and if some
very celebrated people are to be invited,
twenty-one days should elapse between
sending out the invitations and the day
of the function. For a small affair ten
days’ notice is sufficient. Invitations to
large teas should be sent out fourteen days
in advance, but for small ones a week’s notice
is sufficient.</p>

<p>In answering an invitation sent out in the
name of both mother and daughter, one
should address the mother.</p>

<p>When sending out invitations to evening
parties, it is customary to denote the amusement
feature, if there is to be one, by naming
it in the lower left hand corner; as,
“Dancing,” or “Cards,” or “Fancy dress
and masks.” The hour is designated thus:
“Dancing after nine,” or “German at eight
o’clock,” or “Supper at half after seven,”
and underneath “Dancing.” Sometimes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
separate card is enclosed, reading “Dancing
at nine o’clock.”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. George Brown requests the pleasure
of Miss Lee’s company on Tuesday evening,
January seventh, at nine o’clock.</i></p>

<div>
<i>Dancing.</i>      <span class="rightf"><i>221 Thirty-fifth Street.</i></span><br />
</div>

<p>The correct form of invitation for an entertainment
where an elocutionist is to be
the principal feature is worded as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Mrs. James Smith requests the pleasure of
Mr. and Mrs. Brown’s company on Thursday
evening, December the first, at eight
o’clock.</i></p>

<div class="right">
<i>124 Jewell Avenue.</i><br />
</div>

<div class="center"><i>Reading by Professor William White.</i></div></div>

<p>An invitation to a rose or lawn party
might read thus:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="invitation">
<tr><td align="center" colspan="2"><span class="smcap">Mrs. James Smith.<br />
The Misses Smith.<br />
at home<br />
Tuesday evening, June the twenty-eighth,<br />
at eight o’clock.</span><br /></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><span class="smcap">rose party<br />
212 Sheridan Avenue.</span></td>
<td align="center"><span class="smcap">to meet<br />The Misses White.</span><br /></td></tr>
</table></div>



<p>In writing invitations for a club for which
one is acting as secretary it would be wise
to put them in the third person, and then
there would be no embarrassment about the
arrangement of names.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The words “reception” and “at home”
are synonymous. Each means an entertainment
which takes place between certain
stated hours in the afternoon or evening,
where refreshments are served, and no
especial order of amusement is provided,
unless it is specified in the invitations. To
a “reception” or “at home” the hostess
generally sends invitations to all on her calling
list. These large functions are usually
given for some especial purpose; as, to
introduce a <i>débutante</i> into society, to celebrate
a wedding anniversary, or for the
bride and groom after the wedding ceremony,
or merely that the hostess may meet all her
friends.</p>

<p>There is, however, a decided distinction
between a reception or an “at home” and a
tea or “days.” An invitation to the first is
engraved on a sheet of note paper or a large
sized card, and is formally worded. The
hours for the afternoon function are usually
from four until seven, and one may expect
to find at the house or place of entertainment
decorations of flowers and greens, and
quite an elaborate repast provided; but an
invitation to a tea or to “days” does not
imply that anything but the simplest kind
of menu will be served, nor that any but
simple preparations will be made. The
invitations to the latter entertainments may
be the hostess’s visiting cards with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
address and “tea at four o’clock” written in
one corner; or if the hostess prefers to
receive informally on more than one day,
she may have the form “Fridays,” or “Fridays
in February,” or “First and third
Fridays in February,” or whatever days she
chooses, written or engraved on her cards.</p>

<p>The formal luncheon hour is from one to
two o’clock. Afternoon teas are usually at
five. One’s visiting card can be used only
for an invitation for an afternoon “at home;”
invitations to dinner or luncheon must be
written out. In sending out cards for a tea
one should simply write the date and the
hour in the lower left-hand corner; in
sending a note, whether by messenger or
post, the number of the house and the name
of the street should be written out in full.</p>

<p>The following is a good form of invitation
to an “at home” given by several women:</p>

<div class="center">
<span class="smcap">Mrs. James Smith<br />
Mrs. Charles White<br />
Mrs. Frederick Brown<br />
at home<br />
Saturday, April the sixteenth<br />
at four o’clock</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><span class="smcap">112 Madison Street</span></span><br />
</div>

<p>The usual form of an invitation to a
luncheon is as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Mrs. James Brown<br />
requests the pleasure of your company<br />
at luncheon<br />
on Wednesday, April the sixth,<br />
at one o’clock.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Below this and to the right would be the
address, and the date on which the invitation
is written.</p>

<p>The invitation for a musical may be
worded as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="invitation">
<tr><td align="center" colspan="2"><p><i>Mrs. James Smith requests the pleasure of<br />
Miss Brown’s company on Friday afternoon,<br />
March seventeenth, at two o’clock.</i></p></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><i>Music.<br />R.S.V.P.</i> </td><td align="center"><i>24 Queen Avenue.</i></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>

<h3>ANNOUNCEMENT CARDS.</h3>

<p>The simplest way to announce an engagement
is for each of the engaged couple to
write short notes of announcement on the
same day to each one’s relatives and near
friends. All these notes are sent so that
they will be received at the same time.
They are written in the first person on
dainty note paper, and the best form is the
simplest. The character of the note must
depend on the intimacy between the writer
and the recipient.</p>

<p>A pretty and fashionable sequence to the
announcement is for the bride to give a tea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
for the express purpose of receiving congratulations.
She may mention it in her
notes of announcement, and her <i>fiancé</i> may
mention in his notes that she will be at home
on a certain day at a certain hour. She
should then receive with her mother or some
older relative, and she should have some
light refreshment provided for her callers.
All her young friends will call, and all the
relatives and near friends of her <i>fiancé</i>. The
<i>fiancé</i> should be present at the tea, or he
may come before it is over, but he should
not formally receive with his betrothed.</p>

<p>Engagements are often announced in the
newspapers.</p>

<p>Wedding announcements or invitations
should be sent in envelopes addressed to
the father and mother of the family, to the
daughter or daughters (addressed as the
Misses), and to each of the grown sons.
All these invitations in their envelopes may
be enclosed in an outside envelope addressed
to the parents.</p>

<p>A wedding invitation or announcement
card should always be addressed to both
members of a married couple, even if the
bride or groom who sends it is acquainted
with only one.</p>

<p>The correct form for wedding announcement
cards is as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<div class="center">
<span class="smcap">Mr. and Mrs. John Smith<br />
announce the marriage of their daughter,<br />
Anna<br />
to<br />
Mr. Frank Brown<br />
on Saturday, October the twenty-second,<br />
eighteen hundred and ninety-nine.<br />
Washington, D. C.</span><br />
</div>

<p>The bride’s “at home” cards should be
separate, but enclosed with the announcements,
and should read as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<span class="smcap">At Home<br />
Tuesday afternoons in January.<br />
125 West Fifteenth Street,<br />
New York City.</span><br />
</div>

<p>Announcement cards should be sent out
immediately after the wedding to every one
on the bride’s and groom’s list. And, again,
wedding announcement cards need not be
sent out in any one’s name. The following
is an example:</p>

<div class="center">
<span class="smcap">Married<br />
on Wednesday, January the eighteenth,<br />
eighteen hundred and ninety-nine<br />
at St. Thomas’ Church<br />
New York,<br />
Margaret Baker White<br />
to<br />
William Barton.</span><br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>When a bride is an orphan it is customary
for the cards announcing her wedding to be
sent in the name of one of her near relatives,
or else they may read simply like the one
given above.</p>

<p>Wedding announcement cards demand
no acknowledgment from an acquaintance
of the bride who lives at a distance, unless
a “day” or “days” are mentioned on them,
when it is obligatory to send visiting cards
on the “day” or the first one of the “days;”
otherwise, if one wishes to be particularly
polite, one may send a visiting-card in acknowledgment
of the announcement, but it
is not obligatory to do so.</p>

<p>Wedding announcements are sent to
friends at home as well as to those abroad,
because the cards are supposed, not only to
suggest remembrance, but to express a desire
that the acquaintance should be continued
after the name is changed.</p>

<p>The birth of a baby is announced in various
ways, there being no especial rules of
etiquette for making the announcement.
Sometimes engraved cards bearing the baby’s
name and date of birth are sent by themselves
in small envelopes, into which they
fit exactly; sometimes they go in an envelope
with the mother’s visiting-card, and are
written instead of engraved. These cards
should be attached to the mother’s visiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
cards by a piece of white baby ribbon, which
is passed through a hole made in the top of
both cards and tied in a tiny bow. They
should be sent out when the mother is
ready to receive calls.</p>


<h3>WEDDING INVITATIONS.</h3>

<p>Wedding invitations should be issued at
least two weeks before the day of the affair.</p>

<p>It is customary for the bridegroom to give
to the bride’s mother a list of his relatives
and friends to whom he would like cards
sent, and some member of the bride’s family
attends to it.</p>

<p>When the guests at a wedding are limited
to the immediate family, the invitations
may be personal notes sent by the
bride’s mother. The notes may read like
the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>My Dear Mary,—It will give us all much pleasure
if you will come to the very quiet wedding of
my daughter Catherine to Mr. John Martin, on
Saturday, February the fourth, at twelve o’clock,

the ceremony. Only the members of the family will
be present. Hoping that you may be with us the
fourth, I am,</i></p>

<p class="sig">

</div>

<p>If the bride is an orphan, or if there is
any very good reason why her parents’ names
should not appear on the invitation, the
latter may be sent in the name of the married
brother and his wife, or in the name of
whoever gives the bride the wedding reception.
It may read as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>

<h3>ACCEPTANCES AND REGRETS.</h3>

<p>It is considered very rude not to reply to
an invitation immediately, either by note
of acceptance or regret.</p>

<p>In writing acceptances one should never
use “will accept” for “accepts,” or “to
dinner” instead of “for dinner” or “to
dine.”</p>

<p>In accepting a dinner invitation one should
repeat the hour named in order that, if any
mistake has been made, it may be corrected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>An acceptance may be written as follows:</p>

<p><i>Mr. and Mrs. Frank Warren accept with
pleasure Mrs. John Somers’ kind invitation for
Monday evening, October seventh.</i></p>

<p>The following is a good form for a note
of regret:</p>

<p><i>Mr. and Mrs. James Swift regret that,
owing to sickness, they are unable to accept
Mrs. Frank Hall’s kind invitation for Monday
evening, March 16th.</i></p>

<p>In writing regrets, when it is possible to
do so, one should give the reason for not
accepting an invitation.</p>

<p>The best bred people agree that an invitation
to a wedding reception or a wedding
breakfast demands a response, whether or
not a response is requested. But it is another
question when one receives only an invitation
to a church ceremony, or merely an
announcement card with no “at home” card
enclosed, and does not know the bride and
groom well enough to call. If the cards
are sent merely as a matter of courtesy
because of business relations or on account
of a former intimacy in the families, a call
does not seem necessary. In such cases one
must judge more or less for herself, and do
what seems natural. If one lives in a small
place and the bride comes there as a
stranger, it is generally the best way to call,
whatever be the form of the cards received.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Formal invitations to a church wedding
do not demand an answer, unless one is
requested, until the day of the ceremony,
when those unable to attend acknowledge
the invitation with visiting cards addressed
to the father and mother of the bride, or to
whoever sends out the invitations for the
wedding. Invitations to a wedding reception
and a bride’s “At Home” demand no
other acknowledgment than visiting cards
sent on the day of the function by those
unable to attend. A formal invitation to a
house wedding demands the same acknowledgment
as an invitation to a church
wedding.</p>

<p>In acknowledging an invitation to a wedding,
a single woman sends one of her visiting
cards in an envelope addressed to the
mother and father of the bride on the day of
the wedding. A single man sends two of
his cards, and a married couple send one of
the wife’s and two of the husband’s cards.
To the bride on her “At Home” day, cards
should be sent in exactly the same way. A
wedding reception, if it takes place in the
evening, demands full dress.</p>

<p>It is very courteous to acknowledge the
reception of a “commencement” invitation.</p>

<p>It is very bad form to write “Congratulations”
on one’s visiting card and send it
in answer to a wedding invitation. If one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
desires to send her good wishes to the bride,
then a personal note would be proper.</p>

<p>It is also bad form to send a visiting card
with “Regrets” written in one corner instead
of writing the proper note.</p>

<p>If, having accepted an invitation, one
changes her mind, she certainly ought to
give some reason when writing a note of
apology.</p>


<h3>LETTERS.</h3>

<p>In writing letters and notes of invitation,
acceptance, regrets, or introduction, certain
and specific rules of etiquette, ordained by
custom, hold despotic sway; and unless one
is acquainted with these, he must be considered
by those who are, as more or less
uncultivated.</p>

<p>In addressing an envelope one surely
ought to know that the first line of the
address should be at or below the middle
of the envelope, and the address should be
written in a plain hand devoid of flourishes.
The place for the stamp is always the upper
right-hand corner.</p>

<p>In no way is one’s culture sooner made
known than by his manner of writing a note
or letter.</p>

<p>In a formal business letter or in one
commencing “Dear Sir” or “Dear Madam,”
the name of the person addressed is put at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the end of the letter in the left-hand corner,
but it should not be repeated, if it is
used at the head of the letter.</p>

<p>The writing of notes in the third person
is now confined to notes of invitations,
acceptance, and regret.</p>

<p>Nothing would show greater ignorance
than signing one’s name to a note written
in the third person.</p>

<p>In addressing a clergyman it is customary
to commence with “Reverend Sir.” Doctors
of Divinity and of Medicine are thus
distinguished: “The Rev. James Swift, D.
D.,” or “Rev. Dr. Swift;” “I. G. Latham,
M. D.,” or “Dr. Latham.”</p>

<p>In writing to servants, it is customary to
begin thus: “To Mary Bates,—Mrs. White
wishes, etc.”</p>

<p>When a woman is writing to strangers who
will not know whether to address her in reply
as “Mrs.” or “Miss,” the address of
the writer should be given in full, after
signing her letter, as, “Mrs. Jane Smith,”
followed by the direction; or, if unmarried,
the “Miss” should be placed in marks of parenthesis
preceding the signature. One
should never sign her name as “Mrs.” or
“Miss.”</p>

<p>The formal manner of address in a note
or letter written in the first person, is, “My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Dear Mrs. Brown;” the less formal is “Dear
Mrs. Brown.” To an intimate friend one
may use either. “Dear Mary” is less formal
than “My Dear Mary,” and yet to one
who is near, the real significance of the
latter form is very sweet and full of tender
meaning. However, there are no rigid laws
to regulate the correspondence of friends.</p>

<p>When a woman writes a personal note to
a man, no matter how slight her acquaintance
may be with him, it should begin “My
Dear Mr. Brown.”</p>

<p>Ordinary social correspondence, when
forwarded by the hand of an adult socially
equal with the sender, should not be sealed.
If, for some reason, a letter must be sealed,
then the post or some other method of
letter conveyance should be used.</p>

<p>The form “Addressed” on an envelope is
merely the relic of an old legal form that
has no especial significance nowadays, but
is put on the envelope as a matter of
courtesy. It means that the contents of
the envelope are for the person whose
name is written on the outside. It is very
seldom used, and is quite superfluous.</p>

<p>Only letters of unmarried women and
widows are addressed with their baptismal
names. All letters of married women should
bear their husband’s names; as, “Mrs. John
Howe.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Writing on the first, then on the third,
then crosswise on the second and fourth
pages of a letter, facilitates the reading and
is in perfectly good form.</p>

<p>It is very bad taste for a doctor’s wife to
assume his title. An invitation addressed
to them should read “Dr. and Mrs. Jones.”</p>

<p>One should not write “Mrs. John Brown,
<i>née</i> Lottie Smith,” because one is not born
with a Christian name; instead, one would
write “Mrs. John Brown, <i>née</i> Smith.”</p>

<p>The use of perfumed stationery is not
general, nor is it in good taste.</p>

<p>Any letter of congratulation received, even
though it be from a person with whom one
has only a slight acquaintance, requires an
answer.</p>

<p>No matter how fond a young girl may
feel of a man whom she has known for
years, any letters, when trouble comes to
his family, should be addressed to his wife
and not to him.</p>

<p>The fashion that obtains with reference
to placing the date on a letter is to place it
in the upper right-hand corner; on a note it
is usually placed in the lower left-hand
corner.</p>

<p>A young girl who receives letters from a
man at the post-office without the knowledge
of her mother is doing something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
wrong, which in time she will certainly regret,
and which, it is equally certain, will
result in trouble.</p>

<p>It is not in the best taste to write letters of
friendship on the typewriter, but it will always
be excused in the busy woman.</p>


<h3>LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>Letters of introduction are to be regarded
as certificates of respectability and esteem,
and should only be given by friends of the
person introduced and to friends. They
should be brief and carefully worded, intimating
the mutual pleasure that one feels
the acquaintance will confer, but not complimenting
the bearer so openly that he
will feel embarrassed in delivering the letter.
Such letters are left unsealed.</p>

<p>There is no greater insult than to treat a
letter of introduction with indifference. A
person thus introduced ought to be called
upon at once, and shown any other little
attention within one’s power. In England
letters of introduction are called “tickets to
soup.”</p>

<p>In England the party holding a letter of
introduction never takes it himself, but
sends it with his card. On the Continent
the reverse is the fashion. In America the
English custom prevails, though where a
young man has a letter to one many years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
his senior or to one who is to aid him in
some enterprise, he takes it himself at once.</p>

<p>A letter of introduction should be somewhat
like the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<i>My Dear Mr. Barnes:</i><br />

<p><i>This note will introduce to you my friend, Mr.
Charles Smith, whom I know you will be as glad
to meet as he will be glad to meet you.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Smith is an old friend of mine, and any
kindness you may be able to show him will be very
much appreciated by me.</i></p>

<p class="sig">
<i><span style="margin-right: 2em;">Faithfully yours,</span></i><br />
<i>Anna Martin White.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>Before giving a letter of introduction one
should be certain that the persons introduced
will be congenial to each other. Such
a letter puts a certain obligation on the person
to whom it is addressed: he will be
obliged to show the bearer some attention
and hospitality. It is, therefore, not right
to make the demand of a friend unless one
is certain that the acquaintanceship will
compensate him for the trouble he may
take.</p>

<h3>DINNERS.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></h3>

<p>A “dinner” is supposed to be an elaborate
affair, with numerous courses and ample service,
and is usually given at seven or eight
o’clock in the evening. At a dinner the
number of courses naturally varies according
to the taste and financial condition of the
hostess. (For arrangement of the table, see
<a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI</a>.)</p>

<p>For a formal dinner the courses usually
consist of soup, fish, a roast with one or
more vegetables, a salad, an ice or ice cream,
cakes, bonbons, and black coffee. Olives
and salted almonds, jellies, etc., generally
appear in some of the courses.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<p>Although the following really belongs
under the head of “The Table” and “Service
at Table,” a repetition here may not
come amiss.</p>

<p>The attendant places each dish, in succession,
before the host or hostess with the
pile of plates. Each plate is supplied, taken
by the attendant on a small salver, and set,
from the left, before the guest. A second
dish which belongs to the course is presented
at the left of the guest, who helps
himself. As a rule the woman at the right
of the host, or the eldest woman, should be
served first. As soon as a course is finished,
the plates are promptly removed, and the
next course is served in the same way.
Before the dessert is brought on, all crumbs
should be brushed from the cloth. The
finger bowls, which are brought in on a
napkin on a dessert-plate and set at the left
of the plate, are used by dipping the fingers
in lightly and drying them on the napkin.
They should be half full of warm water with
a bit of lemon floating in it. When all
have finished dessert, the hostess gives the
signal, by pushing back her chair, that dinner
is ended, and the guests repair to the
drawing-room, the oldest leading and the
youngest following last, the men passing
into the library or smoking-room.</p>

<p>Seemingly, one should arrive at the house
where one is invited to a dinner or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
luncheon at exactly the hour mentioned in
the invitation; but the proper thing at a
formal function is to get to the house ten
minutes after the hour of the meal, and to
be announced in the drawing-room five
minutes later.</p>

<p>The host, with the guest of honor, leads
the way into the dining-room at a dinner;
at a luncheon the hostess leads the way
alone or with one of the guests.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes is the longest time required
to wait for a tardy guest when the
dinner hour was understood, as it always
should be.</p>

<p>If the hostess thinks the visitor has no
acquaintances in the room, she introduces
her to two or three persons who are near
her, and then, counting on her knowledge
of the customs of society, she will feel quite
sure that her guest will enjoy herself.</p>

<p>A hostess should never reprove a servant
before a guest, as it is unpleasant for all
concerned, and by passing over the annoyance
herself, it may escape the attention of
others.</p>

<p>No accident must seem to disturb a hostess,
no disappointment embarrass her.</p>

<p>At formal dinner parties the servant who
is detailed to attend to the wants of the men
guests hands each one, as he leaves the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
dressing-room, an envelope containing a
card bearing the name of the woman whom
he is to take to dinner.</p>


<h3>LUNCHEONS.</h3>

<p>Luncheons are usually given between the
hours of one and two o’clock in the afternoon,
and to them women only are invited.
The menu is lighter than for a dinner, and
generally consists of sherbets, oyster patties,
scalloped oysters, sweet-breads, sandwiches,
salads, ices, cheese sticks, fruit, ice cream,
cakes, bonbons, salted almonds, olives, and
black coffee, served in such number and
order of courses as best suits the hostess.</p>


<h3>BREAKFASTS.</h3>

<p>The difference between a breakfast and a
luncheon is very slight. On the invitation
the word breakfast is used instead of luncheon,
and the hour is earlier than for a luncheon.
Also men and woman may meet together
for a breakfast, and therefore a few
more solid courses are advisable. Otherwise
one may be guided entirely in giving
the entertainment by the rules which apply
to a luncheon.</p>


<h3>TEAS.</h3>

<p>A tea is the simplest and easiest kind of
an entertainment to give, for the only
essential requisites for its success are prettily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
arranged receiving-rooms, with as many
flowers as one can afford; a gracious hostess,
who stands during the hours of the function
to receive her guests and is properly dressed
in a becoming high-necked house dress; a
few other women, who also receive in pretty
dresses; and a dainty tea table, which may
be presided over by a woman friend or two
of the hostess. It is only necessary to serve
a modest menu of tea, chocolate or bouillon,
assorted sandwiches, fancy cakes, and bonbons.
The other factors to the tea’s success
are pleasant weather and well trained servants,
who may assist in serving the tea
and are alert to open and close the door for
the guests.</p>

<p>At a formal function of any kind the guests
leave their wraps in dressing-rooms, where
one or more maids should be on hand to assist
women in their dressing-room, and a man
to perform the same services in the men’s
dressing-room; but at a small tea, where, as
a rule, the guests do not remove their street
wraps, it is only necessary to have a maid
in the entrance hall to be ready, if called on,
to do any service.</p>

<p>It is not customary to offer refreshments
to casual evening callers; but if one has a
regular evening for receiving, she may have
a tea table in the drawing-room, and serve
tea, chocolate, sandwiches, cake, etc., as in
entertaining on the afternoon of a “day.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>


<h3>RECEPTIONS.</h3>

<p>On the day of the reception, the hostess,
with her assistants, should receive the
guests, standing at the door of the drawing-room.
The refreshment tables should be
spread in the dining-room, and prettily
decorated with flowers, candles in candelabra
or candlesticks, dishes of bonbons and
cakes, plates of sandwiches, and platters of
salad. A bouillon urn may stand at one
end of the table with cups, and coffee may
be served from the other end. All that is
necessary for the menu is bouillon, easily
prepared in the house from canned bouillon,
jellied tongue, chicken salad, and sandwiches,
ices and cake, fruit, and candies.
Coffee and lemonade will suffice for beverages.
If one can afford to have a few pieces
of music, so much the better. The musicians
should play from some hidden nook.
One or two servants in the dining-room, and
one to open and shut the front door, will be
all that is necessary.</p>


<h3>DANCING PARTIES.</h3>

<p>For the form of invitation refer to <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter
II</a>.</p>

<p>In selecting a company for a dancing
party the hostess will naturally choose only
those who dance, and she should see, as far
as possible, that all the women are provided
with partners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>It is better to dance first with one acquaintance
and then with another, rather than to
make one’s self conspicuous by giving a
great number of dances to one man.</p>

<p>A man gives the first and last dances to
his partner of the evening.</p>

<p>No man should invite a young woman to
attend a dress affair without providing a
carriage for her. When the party is small
and informal, it is allowable to go on the
street-cars.</p>

<p>At the end of the dance, the man should
offer his arm to his partner, and take at least
one turn around the room before consigning
her to her seat.</p>

<p>A man who can dance, and will not,
ought to remain away from a ball.</p>

<p>If for any reason a girl should refuse to
dance with one man, she should not accept
another invitation for the same dance.</p>

<p>An invitation to a ball may be asked for a
friend who is a stranger in town, and has
had no opportunity of making the acquaintance
of the one who gives the ball.</p>

<p>A man should not ask a girl, to whom he
has been introduced for the purpose of dancing
with her, for more than two dances the
same evening.</p>


<h3>CARD PARTIES.</h3>

<p>If given, prizes should be carefully chosen,
so that they may be in good taste and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
desirable. The supper should be served at
the card tables after the playing is over.
A large napkin should be spread on the top
of each table, and the refreshments served
in courses.</p>


<h3>WEDDINGS.</h3>

<p>For invitation forms see <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II</a>.</p>

<p>When a wedding takes place in a church
that has but one entrance, the customary
way for the bridal procession to enter is
for the groom and best man to walk in just
behind the minister, a little before the others,
and to take their places at the altar; then
the ushers enter, walking two by two; then
the bridesmaids in the same order; then the
maid of honor alone; and last the bride on
her father’s arm. The bride’s family enter
the church a few minutes before the minister
and the groom and bridal party.</p>

<p>A bride goes up to the altar with her veil
over her face, but comes down with it
thrown back. It is the duty of the maid
of honor to throw it back immediately after
the ceremony is ended.</p>

<p>When the bride’s mother gives her away
at a church ceremony, she usually walks up
the aisle with the bride. After she has
given her to the groom, she steps quietly
and unescorted to the front pew, where she
stays during the remainder of the service.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
The bride may walk up the aisle with an
attendant instead of with her mother, who
in this case steps from her seat in the front
pew to the chancel when the time comes
for her to officiate, and steps back to her
seat afterwards.</p>

<p>The bride and the groom should stand at
the wedding reception until they have received
the congratulations of all present,
then, together, they should walk into the
room where the breakfast is to be served.
The others follow as they please, with the
exception of the parents on both sides. The
groom’s father usually escorts the bride’s
mother, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>It is not the custom for a bride to remove
her gloves at the wedding. The inside
seam of the ring finger of the glove should
be ripped beforehand; and when the time
comes for the ring to be put on, the bride
merely slips off this glove finger, and puts
it back again after the ring is on her finger.</p>

<p>At no wedding service is it proper for the
bride to enter the church alone.</p>

<p>At a church or house wedding where the
bride walks up the aisle with her sister
acting as the maid of honor, instead of with
a gentleman escort, she need not take the
arm of her attendant, as both the ladies will
look more graceful if walking separately.
The maid of honor should carry a bouquet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and the bride a bouquet, prayer-book, or
bible.</p>

<p>At a home wedding the bride enters the
room on the arm of her father. With a
short dress she would not wear a veil.</p>

<p>The wearing of gloves at an informal
wedding is entirely a matter of taste.
Recently at several large weddings they
were omitted by the entire bridal party.</p>

<p>The prettiest way to make an aisle for
the bridal party at a house wedding is for
four children to enter the room where the
ceremony will be, just before the bridal
party comes in, and separate the guests into
two groups by stretching two pieces of
white ribbon the length of the room. A
child stands at each end of the two pieces
of ribbon, holding it while the bridal party
walks up between them, and during the service.
Ushers may hold the ribbons instead
of the children, or the ends may be fastened
around plants which are placed at the requisite
points.</p>

<p>Where there is no side door through
which the groom and best man may enter
the room at a house wedding, they come in
by the principal door just before the bridal
party and just after the minister.</p>

<p>It is not customary for the men at a wedding
party to kiss the bride; that is a liberty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
taken only by the immediate members
of the family.</p>

<p>A bride, if she wishes, may omit the
bridal veil, but she should then wear a
dainty bonnet or picture hat. The ushers
and best men are invited by the bridegroom.</p>

<p>If the church wedding is a full dress one,
followed by an evening reception, it is
proper to wear an evening gown. If it is
in the daytime, a handsome visiting dress
and pretty bonnet are proper.</p>

<p>At a daytime wedding the guests seldom
remove their bonnets, although, of course,
heavy wraps are frequently laid aside. At
an evening affair one goes in full dress without
anything on one’s head. The ushers
present the guests to the bridal party. The
bridesmaids are spoken to by the people
they know, but it is not necessary that they
should be addressed by everybody.</p>

<p>A bride may wear her wedding dress
after her wedding day as much or as little
as she chooses. For the sake of sentiment
many brides like to preserve their wedding
dresses intact to hand down to future generations;
but a girl who has to consider
economy cannot afford to consider sentiment,
and often the wedding dress is converted
into a low dinner and evening gown
soon after the wedding day. A bride may,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
with perfect propriety, wear her wedding
dress to the reception given her after her
wedding by the groom’s mother. Of course,
she will wear it just as it was when she was
married, high in the neck, unless the reception
takes place in the evening and demands
evening dress, when, according to the conventions,
it must be cut low.</p>

<p>A bridegroom is always expected to furnish
the bouquets that the bride, bridesmaids,
and all the bride’s attendants carry
at the wedding. He should learn from the
bride the flowers she wishes, and should
order them several days before the wedding,
so that they may be ready at the
bride’s house when the bridesmaids meet
there to go together to the church or to the
place where the ceremony is held.</p>

<p>Besides furnishing these bouquets, the
groom provides the ushers and best men
with their <i>boutonnières</i>, and gives them also
some small souvenir, and, if he wishes, a
bachelor dinner or supper a day or two before
the wedding.</p>

<p>There are no wedding luncheons nowadays.
Every entertainment of the kind up
to two o’clock is called a breakfast, and
when it takes place in the afternoon or
evening it is called a reception.</p>


<h3>WEDDING GIFTS.</h3>

<p>The idea that a wedding invitation necessitates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
a present has, sensibly enough, gone
out of fashion, and only those who are
bound by ties of blood or close friendship
have the privilege of sending a gift to the
bride.</p>

<p>Presents should be sent as soon after receiving
the invitations as possible. All wedding
gifts, even from friends of the groom
who may never have met the bride, are sent
to the bride; and, if marked, they should
be engraved with the initials or monogram
of the bride’s maiden name, or they may
have her name in full.</p>

<p>Wedding presents should be acknowledged
by the bride-elect in a short personal
note, which should be written and sent immediately
on receipt of the present.</p>

<p>When several friends combine in giving a
present to the bride, she should write a letter
of thanks to each one separately, sending
the letters by post.</p>

<p>It is perfectly proper to open a gift in the
presence of the giver, and express one’s
pleasure and gratitude on the spot. Indeed,
it is much better form to do so than to wait
until the giver has gone.</p>


<h3>WEDDING ANNIVERSARIES.</h3>

<p>The paper wedding, so termed, is celebrated
one year after marriage. Invitations
should be issued on heavy gray paper or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
thin card-board. Presents may consist of
any article made of paper or <i>papier mâché;</i>
such, for instance, as books, engravings,
etc.</p>

<p>The wooden wedding is celebrated five
years after marriage. Invitations may be
issued upon wooden cards, or wooden cards
may be inclosed with an invitation written
or engraved upon a sheet of wedding note
paper. The presents may be anything
made of wood, from a mustard spoon to a
house or set of furniture.</p>

<p>The tin wedding comes ten years after
marriage. Invitation cards are sometimes
covered with tin foil, or tin cards are inclosed,
or, if preferred, the invitation is
printed on tin bronze paper. Presents
should consist of articles made of tin.</p>

<p>The crystal wedding, fifteen years after
marriage, is next in order. Cards may be
issued upon transparent paper, or upon
note paper with a card of isinglass inclosed.</p>

<p>The china wedding takes place twenty
years after marriage. Semi-transparent
cardboard will answer for the invitations.</p>

<p>The silver wedding is celebrated on the
twenty-fifth anniversary, and is generally an
occasion of much more importance than any
of the foregoing anniversaries. The invitations
may be printed on silver paper, and
the presents are, of course, articles of silver.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The golden wedding, celebrated on the
fiftieth anniversary of the marriage, may be
said to be the one in which the young do
homage to the old. It should be conducted
by the near relatives or friends of the
couple, and the occasion should be made
one of retrospect, of encouragement, and of
congratulation. The invitations should be
on white paper in gold letters, and the
presents should be of gold.</p>

<p>At each of these anniversaries it is
customary to have the marriage ceremony
re-performed, and all arrangements for the
celebration are made in about the same
manner as for the first marriage.</p>

<h3>CONVERSATION.</h3>

<p>The late Dr. George Ripley was wont to
say that the secret of being agreeable in
conversation was to be honorable to the
ideas of others. He affirmed that some
people only half listened to you, because
they were considering, even while you
spoke, with what fine words, what wealth
of wit, they should reply, and they began
to speak almost before your sentence had
died upon your lips. These people, he said,
might be brilliant, witty, dazzling, but
never could they be agreeable. You do not
love to talk to them. You feel that they
are impatient for their turn to come, and
that they have no hospitality towards your
thoughts—none of that gentle friendliness
which asks your idea and makes much of it.
This want of hospitality to other people’s
ideas often has its root in egotism, but it is
equally apt to be the growth of a secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
want of self-confidence, a fear that one will
not be ready to take one’s own part well,—an
uneasy self-consciousness which makes real
sympathetic attention to the ideas of others
impossible.</p>

<p>Agreeability, readiness in conversation,
tact and graciousness of manner are great
aids to popularity. To possess these qualities
one must have marked consideration for
others, and be ever ready to manifest it.
One should also be ready to recall faces and
names.</p>

<p>Though one has but few facts and ideas
to draw upon, she may still, by making sufficient
effort, become a fair conversationalist.
If one despair in this direction, she
may at least train herself to become an interesting
listener, and she will be surprised
to find how popular she will be; for three-quarters
of the world like to talk, while to
listen intelligently is a great talent. The
good listener, by her evident interest in, and
sympathetic attention to, the matter of conversation,
brings out all that is best in the
one with whom she talks. Diffident people
forget their shyness in her presence, and
leave her with the comfortable and novel
conviction that they have, after all, acquitted
themselves rather well.</p>

<p>No well-bred person would be guilty of
the gross rudeness of picking up a book or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
magazine and “looking through” it while
pretending to pay heed to the talk of a
friend. The assurance, “I am only looking
at the pictures of this magazine, not reading,
and I hear every word you say,” is no palliation
of the offence. The speaker would be
justified in refusing to continue the conversation
until the pictures had been properly
studied. If a speech is worth hearing,
it is worthy of respectful and earnest attention.</p>

<p>No one should ever monopolize the conversation,
unless he wishes to win for himself
the name of a bore.</p>

<p>A well-educated and finely cultured person
proclaims himself by the simplicity and
terseness of his language.</p>

<p>In conversation all provincialisms, affectations
of foreign accents, mannerisms, exaggerations,
and slang are detestable.</p>

<p>Flippancy is as much an evidence of ill-breeding
as is the perpetual smile, the
wandering eye, the vacant stare, or the half-open
mouth of the man who is preparing to
break in upon the conversation.</p>

<p>Interruption of the speech of others is a
great sin against good breeding.</p>

<p>Anecdotes should be sparsely introduced
into a conversation, lest they become stale.
Repartee must be indulged in with moderation.
Puns are considered vulgar by many.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>In addressing persons with titles, one
ought always to add the name; as, “What
do you think, Doctor Graves?” not, “What
do you think, Doctor?”</p>

<p>The great secret of talking well is to
adapt one’s conversation skillfully to the
hearers.</p>

<p>In a <i>tête-à-tête</i> conversation, it is extremely
ill-bred to drop the voice to a whisper,
or to converse on private matters.</p>

<p>One should never try to hide the lips in
talking by putting up the hand or a fan.</p>

<p>One should avoid long conversations in
society with members of his own family.</p>

<p>If an unfinished conversation is continued
after the entrance of a visitor, its import
should be explained to him.</p>

<p>Though bores find their account in speaking
ill or well of themselves, it is the characteristic
of a gentleman that he never
speaks of himself at all. La Buryere says:
“The great charm of conversation consists
less in the display of one’s own wit and
intelligence than in the power to draw forth
the resources of others; he who leaves one
after a long conversation, pleased with himself
and the part <i>he</i> has taken in the discourse,
will be the other’s warmest admirer.”</p>

<p>In society the absent-minded man is
uncivil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>There are many persons who commence
speaking before they know what they are
going to say. The ill-natured world, which
never misses an opportunity of being severe,
declares them to be foolish and destitute of
brains.</p>

<p>He who knows the world, will not be too
bashful; he who knows himself, will not be
imprudent.</p>

<p>There is no surer sign of vulgarity than
the perpetual boasting of fine things at
home.</p>

<p>One should be careful how freely he
offers advice.</p>

<p>If one keeps silent sometimes upon subjects
of which he is known to be a judge,
his silence, when from ignorance, will not
discover him.</p>

<p>One should not argue a point when it is
possible to avoid it, but when he does argue,
he should do so in a gentlemanly and dispassionate
manner.</p>

<p>One should never notice any mistakes in
the language of others.</p>


<h3>CHAPERONAGE.</h3>

<p>The foreign custom that makes a chaperone
indispensable where young people are
gathered together at places of public entertainment,
has long obtained in the cities of
the East, and in all conventional communities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
everywhere. No really fashionable
party is made up without a chaperone.</p>

<p>A young woman condemns herself in the
eyes of good society who is observed to
enter alone with a young man a place of
public refreshment, be the restaurant or tea
room ever so select. Bred under other conditions
of a society so necessarily varying as
that in our broad America, a stranger visiting
New York, for instance, might readily
and innocently make a mistake of this
nature, and blush at finding herself condemned
for it. In the same category of
offenses is ranked that of maidens visiting
places of public amusement under the escort
of young men alone. Many parts of the
South and West allow this to be done with
the smiling consent of good society; but in
Eastern cities it is considered a violation of
good form, and for the comfort, if not the
convenience, of the girl considering it, had
better be ranked among the lost privileges
upon which social evolution may look back
with fond regret.</p>

<p>It is always wisest, when a number of
young people are to have a party, to ask two
or three married women to be present, not
only for propriety’s sake, but because there
will then be no danger of anything unwished
for happening, inasmuch as it is the duty of
the chaperones to make all social entertainments
smooth and pleasant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>When it is necessary for a girl to pay long
visits to a dentist’s office, she should be
accompanied either by her mother, or some
woman relative, or maid.</p>

<p>The etiquette of chaperonage is much less
strict for a young widow than for an unmarried
girl of the same age; but it is important
and in good taste for a woman who
is a widow to be very quiet and inconspicuous
in all she does, giving by her behavior
no opportunity for criticism.</p>


<h3>MARRIAGE.</h3>

<p>A young girl’s own safety, as regards her
present and future happiness, demands that
she receive attentions from only the best of
young men,—those of whom her reason
would approve, if the acquaintance should
lead to more than acquaintance.</p>

<p>Parents should carefully watch the young
men who frequent their houses, in order to
see that undesirable intimacies are not
formed with their daughters, for friendships
and intimacies soon lead to love.</p>

<p>Many a girl, feeling convinced that she had
loved unwisely, has entered upon the married
state with heart and reason at variance,
when she might have given up the acquaintance,
in the beginning of it, very easily.</p>

<p>The most perfect reserve in courtship,
even in cases of the most ardent attachment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
is indispensable to the confidence and trust
of married life to come.</p>

<p>All public display of devotion should be
avoided, for it tends to lessen mutual respect,
and it makes the actors ridiculous in the
eyes or others. It is quite possible for a
man to show every conceivable attention to
the one to whom he is engaged, and yet to
avoid committing the slightest offence
against delicacy or good taste.</p>

<p>It is quite possible for a man to show
attention, and even assiduity up to a certain
point, without becoming a lover; and it is
equally possible for the girl to let it be seen
that he is not disagreeable to her, without
actually encouraging him. No man likes
to be refused, and no man of tact will risk
a refusal.</p>

<p>Long engagements are usually entered
into by people who are quite young, but
who, for some reason, cannot marry. As
the years go on their tastes may change,
and yet each may feel that honor binds the
one to the other. The woman chosen by a
man when he is twenty-one is seldom the
woman he would chose when he is forty.
When people marry young they grow
accustomed to each other, and, oddly
enough, they grow to be alike; but during
a long engagement their tastes are apt to
change, and the result is apt to be anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
but a happy one. Of course, there are exceptions,
but, generalizing, the long
engagement is to be feared.</p>


<h3>DOMESTIC ETIQUETTE AND DUTIES.</h3>

<p>Etiquette is a comprehensive term, and its
observances are nowhere more to be desired
than in the domestic circle.</p>

<p>If husbands and wives, generally, would
render each other half of the little attentions
they lavished upon each other before marriage,
their mutual happiness would be
more than doubled.</p>

<p>A wife should never let her husband have
cause to complain that she is more agreeable
abroad than at home, nor see her negligent of
dress and manners at home when it is the
reverse in company.</p>

<p>If, unhappily, any misunderstandings or
annoyances occur between husband and
wife, it is ill-bred and unjust for either to
repeat them to a third person.</p>

<p>Faithful unto death in all things should
be the motto of both husband and wife; and
forbearance with each other’s peculiarities,
their never-ending effort to attain.</p>

<p>If a girl discovers very soon after her
marriage that she has made a mistake, it is
wisest for her to make the best of it; she
should look for all that is good in her husband
and try to forget that which she dislikes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
There are times when a legal separation
is necessary, but when people marry
they marry for better or for worse, and if,
unfortunately, it should be for worse, even
that does not release them from the solemn
vows which they have taken.</p>

<p>It is not in good taste for a husband and
wife to call each other by endearing names
in the presence of others.</p>

<p>A man has no right whatever to open his
wife’s mail, but a woman should not receive
any letters that she would not be willing
that her husband should see.</p>

<h3>DRESS.</h3>

<p>In appropriateness our people have something
to learn, as has the whole world, for
that matter. Necklaces and jewels in the
morning are monstrous, no matter what the
fashion of the moment may be, and there
will come a time when every one will look
upon them with horror, as every one, indeed,
used to do.</p>

<p>The day is past when latitude or great
variety in dress is considered original.
Clothes, if they are startling at all, must be
startling in a degree to be borne. A train
cannot be worn where only a short skirt is
in order, nor can an abbreviated drapery go
where full dress is required. A garden
party, for instance, or an out-of-door tea at
a private house demands a muslin, a silk,
or, at any rate, an elaborate toilet, while at
a golf club, such dress is absurd, except for
the elderly or non-players. In winter, frills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and furbelows, if they are worn at all, are
worn at large teas, the plain tailor-made
suit having gone out for such purposes.
However, it is difficult to follow the vagaries
of fashion in these regards.</p>

<p>For morning wear, no dress can be too
simple. Luncheons are growing more and
more informal. When distances are great,
however, and one dresses for calls in the
part of town where the luncheon is, afterward,
more elaborateness of dress is allowed.</p>

<p>The best advice to all girls upon the subject
must be, not to be overdressed, nor yet
to be careless in the matter. They should
attire themselves according to their circumstances,
and should, above all things, avoid
all extremes of fashion, as well as all eccentricities
of style.</p>

<p>Only quiet colors should be worn either
to church or on the street, and wherever
girls go they should endeavor to be unconscious
of their personal appearance.</p>

<p>The woman who is overdressed at an
afternoon reception is much more uncomfortable
than she who is gowned with the
simplicity of a Quaker. A well fitting wool
gown, a becoming bonnet, a fresh pair of
gloves, and one is suitably dressed as a
caller.</p>

<p>A girl of fourteen should not wear her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
hair done up, and her gown should come
just below her ankles.</p>

<p>It is not in good taste for a young girl to
wear diamond rings; if she is fortunate
enough to possess them, let her keep them
carefully until she is older, and then she
may wear them with perfect propriety.</p>

<p>It is in very bad taste to wear a dressing-sacque
when breakfasting in a public dining-room
of a hotel. Such an undress
costume is only permissible in one’s own
room.</p>

<p>A frock coat is, under no circumstances,
a correct garment for a man to wear at an
evening dance, neither is a Tuxedo or dinner
coat. The proper dress is a full dress
suit, with white vest and white string tie.
Possibly a dinner coat might be allowable
at a very small and very informal dance,
but a frock coat never.</p>

<p>A man should wear a white tie with a
dress suit at any large formal entertainment,
such as a ball, the opera, a wedding reception,
a large dinner party, etc., and on all occasions
where he wears a white waistcoat. He should
wear a black tie at the theater, at a small
dinner, in calling, and at home with his
dinner coat.</p>

<p>Evening dress may be as gay as one
chooses to make it, though extremes are
not desirable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Dresses made a suitable length for walking
are much more appropriate for the street
than those that are so long that their wearers
become street cleaners.</p>

<p>Neatness in a lady’s dress is one of the
first requisites.</p>

<p>To dress well requires good taste, good
sense, and refinement.</p>

<p>The most appropriate and becoming dress
is that which so harmonizes with the figure
that the apparel is unobserved.</p>

<p>A hostess should be careful not to out-dress
her guests.</p>

<p>When going out one should consider the
sort of company she is likely to meet, and
should dress accordingly.</p>

<p>The idea that “dress makes the man” is
a very false one, but a man <i>does</i> make, or
select, rather, his dress, and is judged somewhat
in accordance with that selection.</p>

<p>At a five o’clock church wedding the
groom, best man, and ushers all dress as
nearly as possible alike. The proper costume
or suit is a black frock coat, gray
trousers, black or fancy vesting waist coat,
white tie, <i>glacé</i> gloves, patent leather boots,
and a tall hat.</p>


<h3>GLOVES.</h3>

<p>A young woman should of course wear
gloves with a full evening dress to any kind
of an evening entertainment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>On taking one’s seat at a dinner table or
a card table one may remove one’s gloves,
but not until then; and at the theater or
opera, gloves should be worn throughout
the performance and during the evening.</p>

<p>A man wears light or white kid gloves to
the opera, dances, a reception, or any other
formal evening entertainment, except a
dinner.</p>

<p>It is usual to remove one’s gloves when
eating supper at an evening affair, unless
merely a cup of bouillon or an ice may be
chosen, and then there would be no impropriety
in keeping on one’s gloves.</p>

<p>A man wears gloves when calling, and
removes them just before or just after entering
the parlor. Tan gloves may be worn
at all hours of the day; white or pearl
ones are proper in the evening, when calling,
or at any place of amusement.</p>

<p>No matter how long one’s gloves are, they
should be entirely taken off at supper, and
be resumed again upon returning to the
drawing-room or after using the finger
bowls, and before arising from the feast.</p>

<p>To wear gloves while playing cards is an
affectation of elegance.</p>


<h3>STREET ETIQUETTE.</h3>

<p>A man offers his right arm, if either, to a
woman on the street (also in the house),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
that she may have her right hand free for
holding her parasol or guiding her train.
Both common sense and gallantry assign the
woman’s place where it is for her greatest
convenience, and that is, undeniably, on the
right of the man.</p>

<p>The rule for giving the left arm was
held good in those days when it was necessary
for men to pass to the left, thus keeping
the sword-arm free for self-protection or
for the protection of the women, but now
the passing is all to the right.</p>

<p>In walking with a woman a man chooses
the outer side without any regard as to its
being either the right or the left. In walking
with two women he chooses the outer
side also, and never walks between them.</p>

<p>A man walking with a woman returns a
bow made to her, lifting his hat, although
the one bowing is a stranger to him.</p>

<p>Ladies do not talk or call across the street.</p>

<p>Men should not smoke when driving or
walking with women, nor on promenades
much frequented, where they cannot remove
the cigar from the mouth whenever meeting
a woman.</p>

<p>One should never stare at another.</p>

<p>A man when meeting a woman who is
walking and with whom he wishes to converse,
does not allow her to stand while
talking, but turns and walks with her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>A man cannot refuse to return the bow of
any respectable woman. If he does not
wish to recognize her he must avoid her.</p>

<p>It is much less rude for women to return
a recognition coldly, and upon the next
occasion to turn away or to avoid a meeting,
than to give a “cut direct.”</p>

<p>A man precedes a woman in passing
through a crowd; but women precede men
under ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>It is not proper for a young girl to walk
alone with a young man after dark, unless
she is engaged to him or he is a near relative
of hers. A young woman should meet a
young man with whom she has only a slight
acquaintance under her father’s or a proper
guardian’s roof. When he has become well
acquainted with her and her family or
friends, she may take occasional walks with
him alone in the afternoon, but never in the
evening.</p>

<p>When two women meet in a door-way,
the younger gives precedence to the elder.</p>

<p>A man does not first offer to shake hands
with a woman unless he is very well
acquainted with her.</p>

<p>When it becomes necessary for one to
address a man or woman whose name one
does not know, it should be as “Sir” or
“Madam.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very bad taste for young women to
eat candy during a theatrical performance,
or, indeed, in any public place.</p>


<h3>TRAVELING.</h3>

<p>One can travel all over the United States
alone, and if she conducts herself quietly,
and as a lady should, she will receive all
due respect. At the same time it is perhaps
a little wiser to have a friend with one, or
even, if that is not possible, to be put in
the care of some one who is making the same
journey.</p>

<p>When a young woman is traveling alone
and is obliged to stay at a hotel, she is
shown to a reception room and sends for a
clerk to come to her. After the business
arrangements are made, she either gives
him a card or tells him her name, and he
registers for her. There is no reason why
she should go into a public room or register
herself.</p>

<p>It is not customary, unless one is without
luggage, to pay in advance at a hotel.</p>

<p>Fees are usually given on leaving the
steamer to the steward or stewardess, deck
steward, head waiter, waiter of the particular
table at which one has taken his meals,
and any other servants who have made
themselves useful to him during the voyage.
The amount of the fees depends on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
amount of the service that has been required,
varying from $1 to $5 for each.
Living in lodgings abroad is much cheaper
than living in hotels, and in most of the
large cities such accommodations may be
had at reasonable rates, and are very comfortable.
The prices for lodging vary according
to location, etc. A steamer trunk
should suffice for a traveler who makes
a short trip abroad and intends to spend
all his time traveling and sight-seeing.
Money for a short trip can be carried
on the person, in a belt, or a pocket
hung about the neck. For a trip of some
length a letter of credit is more convenient,
and can be obtained from any banking-house
having foreign connections. In some
countries traveling in the second-class carriages
is very comfortable; in others it is
not. In Italy a traveler can be comfortable
only by traveling first-class; in France
second-class is not bad; and in Germany
and Great Britain it is perfectly comfortable,
and preferable to first-class in many
respects.</p>

<p>A rush and scramble at a railway ticket
office is only carried on by ill-bred people,
or by those who appear so at the time.</p>

<p>If a woman offers to seat herself beside
a man, he should rise at once and give her
the choice of seats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>No real gentlemen would be unmindful
of the comfort and convenience of women,
while traveling, from a selfish motive.</p>

<p>In the cars one has no right to keep a
window open, if the current of air thus
produced annoys another.</p>

<p>A woman should always be careful to
thank a person for any little attention he
may bestow upon her while traveling.</p>


<h3>BICYCLING.</h3>

<p>As to rules of politeness for bicyclers, one
who is a true lady will show herself to be
one as surely when riding a wheel as at any
other time, not only by her costume, which
will be unobtrusive in color, cut, and adjustment,
but by her manner, which will be
even more quiet and self-possessed than
usual, as she well knows that by mounting
a wheel she makes herself more or less conspicuous.
It goes without saying that she
will not ride fast enough to attract undue
attention; that she will not chew gum; and
that she will not allow advances from strangers,
who may, like herself, be on a wheel,
and, to all appearances, may be gentlemen.
Neither will she ride off alone after dark,
nor take long rides in the evening attended
only by an escort. In the daytime, when
out only with a man friend, she will avoid
stopping to rest under the trees and in out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the way places. Too much care cannot be
taken, especially by young girls, as to appearances.
Their very innocence and ignorance
lays them open to criticism.</p>


<h3>TELEPHONING.</h3>

<p>For the benefit of those who but seldom
make use of the telephone, and consequently
feel more or less ill at ease when attempting
to use one, and also for those who, from ignorance
of the first laws of politeness, or who,
from thoughtlessness, ignore them, a few
hints upon the subject may not come amiss.
It is after having called up “Central,” and
been given the number requested, that one
often stands in need of no small amount of tact
and good breeding, as well as of some idea of
the best method of procedure. When there
are several different persons using the same
line, two or three of them may mistake the
call for theirs, and all rush to the telephone
at once. If at all stupid, or lacking in
politeness, they will make it quite unpleasant
for each other. The one entitled to
speak should politely inquire for the one
for whom she has called at the telephone,
also giving her own name as the one delivering
the message. If this does not suffice
to enlighten those who sometimes keep
calling “hello,” “hello,” without waiting
to learn if they are the ones desired, the
one talking should again announce herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and the name of the one to whom she
wishes to speak. Then, occasionally, even
while in the midst of a conversation,
some one will break in with a “Hello!”
“Who is it?” “What do you want?” etc.,
which is quite distracting. If one can gain
a hearing in no other way, it is well to say:
“Excuse me, I hold the line.” If this does
not bring order out of chaos, one should
ring off and call again.</p>

<p>One should be careful not to call up
friends at inconvenient hours, and when one
is notified by a servant, or otherwise, that
someone, the name being given, is at the
telephone wishing to speak with her, she
should certainly be as expeditious as possible
in replying; for, by holding the wire,
she is inconveniencing others, as well as the
one who is waiting for her. No lady needs
to be warned against speaking discourteously
under any circumstances to the telephone
assistants at the central office. It is
in these little things that one shows herself
to be well-bred or not.</p>

<p>None, of course, but the most informal of
invitations can be delivered by telephone.</p>

<p>Servants should be taught always to answer
the telephone politely and intelligently.
When answering, a servant should say
whose residence it is, if asked, not by giving
the family name, as “Smith,” but as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
“Mr. Smith,” and then, if asked who is at
the instrument, she should reply, “Mrs.
Smith’s cook” or “maid.”</p>

<p>One’s individual manners, and ordinary
polite or impolite forms of address, are very
noticeable when accentuated by the telephone.</p>

<h3>THE TABLE AND SERVICE AT TABLE.</h3>

<p>The table looks best when not over-decorated.
The housekeeper who cannot make
changes in her table decoration finds that a
mirror centerpiece is a background that
multiplies the beauty of her flowers, fruit,
leaves, or whatever may constitute the
decoration.</p>

<p>A unique and effective decoration for a
luncheon table is made of long, narrow bouquets
of white carnations, tied with bows of
yellow satin ribbon, and arranged so that
the ribbons all meet in the center of the
table, while the points are directed towards
the guests. The effect is of a great golden-hearted
daisy.</p>

<p>A pretty conceit for decorating a dainty
table is to cluster a number of small palms together
in the center of the table. Around
these place small ferns, while beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
latter arrange yards of smilax so as to conceal
the pots. Outside of all have a flat
border composed of loose bunches of pinks,
roses, and maiden-hair ferns. Tie these with
wide pink satin ribbons, a long end of which
should extend from each bouquet down to
the place of each of the women guests, and
have her name painted in gold upon it.
Then there should be <i>boutonnières</i> of pink
carnations for the men.</p>

<p>Menu cards are not ordinarily used at any
but the most formal kind of an entertainment.
They are always seen at large functions,
men’s public dinners, etc., which are
usually given in a hotel or restaurant; but
in a private house individual menu cards,
whether at a dinner or a luncheon, are exceptional.</p>

<p>When the dinner is large and formal, or
even when it numbers only eight or ten, it
is wise to have small cards with the names
of the guests at each place at the table,
and, if the guests are strangers to each
other, to have a tray in the men’s dressing-room
or hall where they remove their coats
and hats with tiny envelopes addressed to
each, containing little cards on which is
written the name of the dinner partner. The
hostess must see that, as soon as two dinner
partners are in the receiving room before
dinner, they meet each other, and have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
chance for a little conversation before the
meal is announced; and she should also
make a point to introduce each woman before
dinner to the man who is to sit on the
other side of her.</p>

<p>Introductions are not proper at the table,
and at a large dinner it is awkward to introduce
all one’s guests to each other before
the meal. At a small dinner, of course, it
is not necessary to observe all this formality,
and the hostess may introduce her guests
to each other without much ceremony, when
the company numbers only four or six; but
with more, each woman should be provided
with a partner who escorts her to the table.
At a small function there need be but a
few minutes of waiting before the guests
are all seated. The guest of honor sits at the
right of the host.</p>

<p>As to the manner of arranging the table,
there is some difference of opinion. However,
generally speaking, there should be a
napkin, squarely folded, in front of each
guest, and at the left of it the forks, <i>i. e.</i>,
a fish fork and a large and a small ordinary
fork. At the right of the napkin should be
the knives and spoons, a glass, bread-and-butter
plate (if used), and a salt cellar; and
in the center of the table on an embroidered
centerpiece or circular mirror, the floral
decorations. At the head of the table, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
an embroidered square, are laid the tea service,—the
urn, the cups and saucers, the
cream pitcher, sugar bowl, etc.; at the other
end are placed the dishes for serving. Scattered
about on circular doilies are the dishes
of jelly, preserves, pickles (sweet and sour),
olives, salted almonds, etc.</p>

<p>Chafing-dishes are used to prepare such
dishes as terrapin, oysters, or whatever may
be cooked absolutely on the table. A napkin
and plate, or tray, is best liked for
removing crumbs.</p>

<p>Finger bowls should always follow the
last course at formal and informal meals
alike, except at breakfast, when, if fruit is
the first course, the finger-bowl is put on
the table when the covers are laid ready for
the fruit course.</p>

<p>Spoon-holders are no longer used, but if
one should be fancied it would be better to
put the bowl of the spoon in the holder first.</p>

<p>Unless one serves something more than
wafers, small cakes, tea, and chocolate on
an “at home” day, napkins are not necessary;
if, however, there is some dish that
will soil the fingers or the lips, then there
should be a pile of small napkins on the tea-table.</p>

<p>Tooth-picks should not be put on the
table, nor should they be used outside one’s
own room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not necessary to fold one’s napkin
when only one meal is to be eaten in the
house in which one is staying.</p>

<p>The day for tying cakes, sandwiches, etc.,
with ribbons has passed.</p>

<p>The waitress should stand with a tray in
her hand behind the host’s chair to receive
each plate as it is filled, passing it to the
left of the guest, and waiting for him to remove
it. When the hostess is pouring tea
or coffee, the maid’s place is by her
left side in waiting for the cups. After
that she should be on the alert to see when
the glasses need filling, or when there is
bread, pickles, or anything to be passed.
When removing the plates it should be from
the right side of the guest, but everything
should be offered at the left that the right
hand may be used to receive it.</p>

<p>When a dish is passed and there is no
maid in attendance, one should help himself
and pass it on. If a dish is standing
near one, under such circumstances, he may
quite properly ask if he may help himself,
and do so.</p>

<p>When a plate is passed for a helping, the
knife and fork are laid well to the side of
the plate, so placed that they will not fall
off, and yet not be in the way of the server.</p>

<p>All the appurtenances of each course
should be removed before the succeeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
one is served. The bread-and-butter plates,
however, should be removed before the salad
course, as crackers and cheese are passed
with this, the salad plate being used to hold
all three things.</p>

<p>The salted almonds should be started
about the table by the hostess soon after the
guests are seated. Some hostesses possess
cut-glass or china individual dishes, on
which the almonds are placed when the
guest helps himself, but it is quite usual for
them to be placed on the bread-and-butter
plate.</p>

<p>Bonbons should be passed by the maid
when the coffee is served, and eaten from
the plate from which the finger-bowl and
doily have been removed.</p>

<p>It is not important whether tumblers or
goblets are used on the dinner-table; each
season brings its own custom.</p>

<p>The bread-and-butter plates at a formal
dinner serve the purpose only of bread
plates, as it is not customary to serve butter
on such occasions. If it is used, however,
butter should be made into tiny balls,
and one or two placed on each bread-and-butter
plate.</p>

<p>It is customary to put the vegetables
served with the meat on the same plate.
The use of individual dishes for vegetables
is no longer approved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Oranges are seldom served at dinner unless
they are specially prepared, that is,
with the skin taken off, and the sections
divided, in which case the fruit is eaten
from a fork.</p>

<p>Cheese and crackers of some sort are always
served with salad courses.</p>

<p>At a formal dinner bouillon or consommé
is usually served in soup-plates. At a supper
or luncheon it is oftenest served in cups.
The regulation cups are those having handles
on each side.</p>

<p>When oysters are served on the half-shell,
they are usually placed upon the table before
the meal is announced.</p>

<p>It is not customary to serve fruit as a
first course at dinner, though at a lunch it
is quite proper.</p>

<p>Grape-fruit must be served ice cold. It
is served in two ways: either it is cut in
halves, midway between the blossom and
the stem end, the seeds removed, the pulp
loosened with a sharp knife, but served
in the natural skin, to be eaten with a
spoon; or the pulp and seeds are entirely
removed from the skin with a sharp knife,
and the edible part only served in deep
dessert plates. Pulverized sugar should
accompany grape-fruit.</p>

<p>In waiting upon plates, one should never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
pour gravy on the food, but place it at one
side.</p>

<p>The salad course at dinner always succeeds
the game course.</p>

<p>After dinner coffee is served in small
cups and without cream. In many houses
rock-candy, crushed in very small pieces, is
used as a substitute for sugar, the claim
being made that it gives a purer sweetness.</p>

<p>Cut sugar is served with coffee, and powdered
sugar with fruit or oatmeal.</p>

<p>Coffee may be served at the table or in
the drawing-room as is best liked. People
are not asked if they will have it; it is
served to them. Only sugar is offered with
black coffee.</p>


<h3>HABITS AT TABLE.</h3>

<p>Nothing indicates the good breeding of a
man so much as his manners at table.
There are a thousand little points to be observed,
which, although not absolutely
necessary, distinctly stamp the refined and
well-bred man. A man may pass muster by
dressing well, and may sustain himself tolerably
in conversation; but, if he is not
nearly perfect in table etiquette, dining will
betray him.</p>

<p>Any unpleasant peculiarity, abruptness,
or coarseness of manner is especially offensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
at table. People are more easily disgusted
at that time than at any other.</p>

<p>One should never rest the arms upon the
table, but keep the left hand, when not in
use, lying quietly in the lap.</p>

<p>A man guest should never precede his
hostess into or out of the dining-room, but
should wait respectfully by the door for her
to pass.</p>

<p>A soup-plate should never be tilted for
the last spoonful.</p>

<p>The mouth should be kept closed in eating,
and as little noise made as possible.</p>

<p>A goblet should be held by the stem, and
not by the bowl.</p>

<p>Bread should be broken and not cut before
buttering it to eat.</p>

<p>A knife should never be used at table except
where one is unable to cut his food
with his fork; it should never be used in
conveying food to the mouth.</p>

<p>A knife should be held by its handle, and
the finger not allowed to extend up on the
blade. In eating with a fork it should be
held in the right hand.</p>

<p>The fork is generally used with the tines
curving upward.</p>

<p>Olives are eaten from the fingers; pickles,
from a fork. It is usual to put either a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
small fork or a long-handled spoon with a
small bowl on the dish containing olives
or pickles, and one should use it in helping
one’s self.</p>

<p>The tips of the fingers are put in the
finger-bowls and may then moisten the
lips. Both lips and finger tips are dried on
the napkin, which is not afterwards folded.</p>

<p>Watermelons are eaten with a fork, and
cantaloupes with either a spoon or a fork.</p>

<p>A baked potato should be eaten from the
plate after it has been pushed out of its
skin by the fork.</p>

<p>Dried beef is eaten with a fork.</p>

<p>Grape seeds may be removed from the
mouth with the fingers. The seeds of
watermelons should be taken from the fruit
with a fork before the fruit is put into the
mouth.</p>

<p>Fish bones are taken from the mouth
with the fingers. Care, however, is usually
taken to leave as few bones as possible in
the fish, since the general use of the silver
knife with the silver fork has made it easy
to separate the bones from the meat.</p>

<p>Bananas are broken with a fork, and a
piece is conveyed to the mouth on a fork.</p>

<p>When a servant offers one a dish, he
should help himself without taking it from
her hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>When drinking from a cup, the spoon
should be left in the saucer, where it also
remains when the cup is empty.</p>

<p>It is not proper to eat gravy with bits of
bread; instead, it should be regarded as a
sauce, and simply eaten on the meat of
which it forms a portion.</p>

<p>It is decreed by custom that the small
bones of any bird may be taken in the fingers,
and the meat eaten from the bone.
But this must always be done daintily.</p>

<p>What is known as “layer cake” is eaten
from a fork, and in serving it one uses
either a pie-knife or a tablespoon and a
fork.</p>

<p>Cheese is eaten with a fork.</p>

<p>After-dinner coffee is taken directly from
the cup, and not from the spoon.</p>

<p>Crackers should be eaten from the hand,
and not be broken into soup.</p>

<p>When bread is passed, one takes a slice
as it is cut, and does not break it and leave
a portion on the plate. Bread is always
eaten from the fingers.</p>

<p>Raw oysters are eaten with a small
oyster-fork from the shell. In helping
one’s self to salt, the little salt-spoon is
used, and the salt is placed on the plate.</p>

<p>When strawberries are served with their
stems on, one picks one up by the stem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
dips it into the soft sugar at the side of the
plate, and eats it from the stem. Bonbons
are eaten from the fingers. If a spoon is in
the dish from which they are served, then
one uses it; if not, the fingers are proper.</p>

<p>An apple or a pear may be held on a fork,
and pared with a knife; or it may be quartered,
and each quarter held in the fingers,
and then pared. Dates are eaten from the
fingers.</p>

<p>When one answers “thank you” to an
invitation to partake of a certain dish at the
table, “yes” is meant.</p>

<p>One should break a small piece of bread
off the slice, then butter it and eat it. Only
very small children in the nursery bite from
a slice of buttered bread.</p>

<p>One need not fear to take the last piece
on the plate when it is offered. It would
be more impolite to refuse it.</p>

<p>It is very bad form to pile up, or in any
way arrange the plates or small dishes put
before one, for the benefit of the waiter.
She should do her own work, which is to
take away the plates without any help.</p>

<p>When one wishes for bread, or anything
of that sort, he should simply ask for it,
either addressing his request to the servant
or, if there is none, to whomever the bread
may be nearest, if it is on the table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon leaving the table, and the signal
for leaving is given when the hostess rises,
one’s napkin should be placed upon the
table unfolded, unless one is to remain for
another meal.</p>

<p>At a formal dinner party the host should
enter the dining-room first and with the
lady in whose honor the dinner is given;
the hostess goes into the dining-room last
with the most important man guest, who
should be seated at her right.</p>

<p>Where menus are used they should be
placed on the left-hand side, beside the
forks. When the dinner is over, at a signal
from the hostess, the women rise and retire
to the drawing-room, where coffee is
usually served, the men remaining in the
dining-room for coffee and cigars.</p>

<p>Five o’clock tea may be served in a variety
of ways: the hostess may brew it herself
in a teapot upon her tea-table in the
parlor; she may make it by pouring boiling
water over a tea-ball; or it may be served
by either a man or maid servant in the dining-room.
Its proper accompaniments are
sugar, cream, sliced lemon, and either wafers,
thin sandwiches, or cake.</p>

<p>It is in better form to have a luncheon
served at a large table, especially when the
guests do not number more than twenty,
than to have small tables. Two o’clock is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the fashionable hour for a luncheon; after
it is over the guests usually disperse.</p>

<p>A host, in entertaining at a hotel or a restaurant,
even if he entertains only one
woman, should give the order for the meal
himself, and save her the slight embarrassment
it may be for her to make her own
selection. The most courteous thing is for
him to order the meal beforehand, but if
the occasion is very informal and he prefers
to wait until they are at the table, he
should, after he and his guest are seated,
hand the menu to her and ask if she has
any especial preference, and then, respecting
her wishes, give the order himself to
the waiter.</p>

<p>If, however, friends happen in, and are
asked informally to stay to a meal at a
hotel, they may order themselves what they
want from the menu, and, if necessary, the
host or hostess of the occasion may pay the
bill before leaving the dining-room, but the
bill should not be paid until the guests have
departed.</p>

<p>In giving one’s order for dinner at the
hotel, oysters come first, then soup, fish, a
roast or a bird, ices, whatever dessert
may be desired, and coffee. Very often a
woman is well served, when she is alone, by
allowing the waiter to arrange a dinner for
her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>If the only guest at the family dinner-table
is a man, he should not be served
until all the ladies of the family have been
attended to.</p>

<p>If the hostess is the only woman at the
table, she is served first, as a lady is of
most importance from a social standpoint,
and it is always proper to attend to her
wants first. After her the man who is a
visitor, or whose age gives him precedence,
receives attention.</p>

<p>The guest of honor at a tea arrives a little
earlier than the other guests, and remains
somewhat later, but at a luncheon or dinner
she should appear at the regulation time.
One should remove one’s gloves at a luncheon,
but the retaining of the hat is entirely
a matter of personal taste.</p>

<p>The inconsiderate guest who arrives late
for luncheon or dinner is shown immediately
into the dining-room, and the hostess
does not leave her guests, but simply rises
and motions him to a seat when he enters
the room.</p>

<p>Ten minutes is the time usually allowed
for each course where more than a six-course
dinner is served.</p>

<p>The correct and usual way of seating a
bridal party at a wedding entertainment is
for the groom to sit at one end of the table,
and the bride at the other end, the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
man on the bride’s right, and the maid of
honor or first bridemaid on the groom’s
right. The other bridemaids and ushers are
placed wherever seems best. As a usual
thing, the parents of the bride and groom
do not sit at the same table with the immediate
bridal party, but at another table, together
with the near relatives on both sides,
and perhaps the minister who officiated at
the wedding and his wife; but if it seems
desirable to have the parents at the bridal
table, it is perfectly proper to seat them
there.</p>

<p>There are certain distinctive features of a
bridal table which must be in evidence.
One is the wedding or bride’s cake, and this
cake should be the central ornament, and
should be surrounded with a wreath of
roses. The place-cards should have the initials
of the bride and groom woven together
for decoration, and the souvenirs may be
small satin boxes containing wedding cake.</p>


<h3>SERVANTS AND SERVING.</h3>

<p>There is so much to say upon the subject
of servants, notwithstanding so much has already
been said, it is difficult to know where
to begin. But, in the first place, every
woman should remember that servants are,
like herself, human, and that in our free
America, they are becoming very independent,
not to say self-assertive. Thus a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
house mistress has no small matter to deal
with when she demands obedience and respectful
attention from girls who are generally
ignorant, and often impudent and ill-bred.
The greatest strength of the mistress
lies in her power to control herself, and
while she must demand respectfulness from
her servants, she can often avoid a clash
with them by using a little tact. If they
are treated in a kind, though dignified, manner,
unless very degenerate, they will usually
respond satisfactorily.</p>

<p>One can speak, with perfect propriety, of
the one servant employed as “the maid,”
but not as “our girl.”</p>

<p>Servants should be expected to dress neatly,
and where there is but one, she should
have a clean white apron ready to put on
when answering the door-bell, being prepared
with a tray to receive the caller’s card.
She should also know, before answering the
bell, who is in and who is not at home, and
what excuse, if any, to make for each one
called for.</p>

<p>Servants should never be allowed to call
any member of the family from a distance,
as from the foot of the stairs, but should go
to the one to whom she wishes to speak,
and deliver her message.</p>

<p>It is hard to say, under all circumstances,
what to expect of a nursery governess, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
what should be her privileges. To treat
her with the greatest consideration is well
worth while; for one is compensated in being
able to get an intelligent, ladylike woman
who may be trusted to guide her charges
wisely. One may ask a governess to sleep
in the same room with the children, dress
and undress them, eat with them, and teach
them, and take the entire charge of them;
but, of course, one will provide some attractive
place for her to sit during the evening,
while the children are asleep in her room.
It is also necessary to see that her meals are
well cooked and carefully served, and to
permit her to be free one afternoon and evening
every week. She should be addressed
as “Miss Smith,” not by her first name.</p>

<p>It is expedient to supervise the work of
the general house-work servant as much as
possible; and if it is more convenient for
her to go up the front stairs to announce
callers, and to go down them to answer the
front door, certainly allow her to use the
front stairs instead of the back ones on occasions.
A waitress or parlor-maid is no
more privileged to use the front stairs than
a general house-work servant. A nurse
may be, with propriety, wherever her charges
are allowed.</p>

<p>If a maid is expected to wear a cap, it is
usually furnished by the lady of the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>It is good form to address the servants one
knows when entering a house, and to thank
them for any attention.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the English system
of feeing has come into vogue here. But it
is quite customary now, for a guest, after a
visit, even a short one, to bestow upon a
servant a small fee, say, of a dollar.</p>

<h3>FUNERALS.</h3>

<p>At no place is a lack of system, and an
observance of formality, more noticeable than
at a funeral. An undertaker generally has
charge of the details, and where he is well
informed and has sufficient assistance, he
can manage affairs nicely, but there is a
great deal of unostentatious service that
may be done by friends, indeed, must be.
They can assist the servants in arranging
the house, flowers, etc., before the funeral;
meet any who may call at the door;
and in every way stand between the afflicted
family and the outside world. Of course
none but intimate friends can be of service
at such a time. All others, no matter how
willing, can but call at the door with offers
of service, and even that should not be carried
far enough to appear intrusive.</p>

<p>At a house funeral the family remains upstairs,
or in a side room, and is not seen.
The remains are in the drawing-room, where
they are usually viewed by those present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
when passing out. The clergyman stands
near the head of the casket, if in so doing
his voice can be well heard. If there is singing,
it is usually done by a quartet or by a
smaller number of persons, who are seated at
the head of the stairs out of sight and unaccompanied
by any musical instrument.
Those who are not going to the cemetery
quietly disperse at the close of the service.
Carriages are in waiting for the family, and
the cortege moves as soon after the close of
the service as possible.</p>

<p>In the meantime the nurse (if one still
remains at the house), or some friend, with
the assistance of the servants, makes everything
look as natural and pleasant as possible
before the return of the family. If visitors
come in later, of course it depends upon
circumstances whether or not they should
be admitted.</p>

<p>Church funerals are more formal. The
congregation assembles, and when the
carriages containing the family arrive, the
organ plays softly, and the procession enters,
the relatives walking close to the casket,
and sitting as near it as possible. After
the services the procession moves out in the
same order, and the people in the pews wait
until is has passed on.</p>

<p>The crêpe that is hung at the door-bell
has often combined with it ribbon streamers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
those for the aged being black, for a
younger person purple, and for a child
white with white crêpe also. Flowers
should be sent to the bereaved, in due time
after the death, in token of sympathy.</p>


<h3>MOURNING.</h3>

<p>The putting on of mourning is a question
that should be decided entirely by those
most deeply concerned. Many families
never follow the custom, and even wear
white instead of black on the day of the
funeral, while others seem to consider the
wearing of crêpe as a mark of respect shown
to the dead. To assume the expense such
a change in clothing would entail, may
sometimes be placing a burden upon the
living for the sake of the dead, which certainly
neither custom nor reason should demand.
Then, to many, the wearing of
crêpe is so depressing that it is a sin against
one’s self to put it on. None but narrow-minded,
uncultivated persons would ever
think of criticising one for not doing so.
Of course one would naturally feel like dressing
in as subdued colors as possible, if
not in assuming half mourning (black and
white, lavendar, drab, etc.) if not deep
black or crêpe.</p>

<p>When mourning is worn by a wife for a
husband, it is worn from one to two years,
at least.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>The question of wearing mourning for
one’s betrothed must be decided by one’s
self, for it is purely a personal question that
the laws of etiquette do not govern.</p>

<p>When crêpe is laid aside, black-bordered
paper and black-bordered cards are no longer
proper. While wearing all black on the
street, after crêpe is laid aside, one may
wear, with propriety, all white in the house.</p>

<p>While in deep mourning one does not go
into society. All that mourning etiquette
demands is that one acknowledge her calls
with her visiting cards, which should be
sent in return for a call within two weeks
after it is made, and should go by hand
rather than by mail.</p>

<p>One sends invitations to one’s friends who
are in mourning, to show that they are not
forgotten.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small><span class="smcap">Politeness of Young Children.</span></small></h2>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>Give a boy address and accomplishments,
and you give him the mastery of palaces and
fortunes wherever he goes.—<i>Ralph Waldo
Emerson.</i></p></div>


<p>A mother once asked a clergyman when
she should begin to educate her child, then
three years old. “Madam,” was his reply,
“you have lost three years already.”</p>

<p>As soon as the child can talk, its lessons
in politeness should begin. Among a child’s
first words should be “please” and “thank
you.”</p>

<p>A child should never be allowed to leave
the table, after it is old enough to understand
and to say it, without asking to be
excused.</p>

<p>A child should be taught to pass behind
and not before one.</p>

<p>Little boys should never be allowed to
keep their hats on in the house.</p>

<p>Children, when very young, should be
taught to be generous and polite to their
little visitors, and, if necessary, to give up
all of anything where half will not do.</p>

<p>Children should be taught to “take turns”
in playing games, and that no one should
monopolize the pleasantest part of a game.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Children soon feel a pride in being little
ladies and gentlemen, rather than in being
rude and impolite.</p>

<p>If mothers would impress upon their children’s
minds how stupid they appear when
they stand staring at one without answering
when addressed with “good morning” or a
like salutation, they would be anxious to
know what to say, and to say it.</p>

<p>Children do not always know what to answer
when addressed. They ought to be
taught, so that they may feel no embarrassment.</p>

<p>When children inconvenience others, they
ought to be taught to say “excuse me” or
“beg pardon.”</p>

<p>In the cars, or in any public place, a boy
or a girl should always rise, and give his or
her place to an older person.</p>

<p>A child should always learn that it is both
naughty and rude to contradict, and to say
“what for” and “why,” when told to do
anything.</p>

<p>A mother who is as careful of her child’s
moral nature and manners as of his physical
nature, will guard him from naughty
and rude playmates as closely as she would
from measles or whooping-cough.</p>

<p>A mother should never allow any disrespect
in her children’s manners toward herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
nor toward any one older than they
are. They should be taught especially to
reverence the aged.</p>

<p>Habits of politeness and kindness to the
poor are of great worth, and easily formed
in childhood.</p>

<p>Virtue is born of good habits, and the
formation of habits may be said to constitute
almost the whole work of education.</p>

<p>Habits have been compared to handcuffs,
easily put on and difficult to rid one’s
self of.</p>

<p>Those parents who regulate their lives in
accordance with the commands of the Bible,
find many verses which are of great assistance
in teaching politeness to young children,
such as, “Be ye courteous one to another,”
“Be respectful to your elder,” “Do
to others as ye would that they should do to
you,” etc.</p>

<p>A child should be thoroughly trained
with regard to table manners. The well-bred
child will not chew his food with his
mouth half open, talk with it in his mouth, nor
make any unnecessary noises in eating; and
he will handle his knife and fork properly.</p>

<p>Children should be taught that it is very
rude to look into drawers or boxes, or, in
fact, to meddle with or handle anything
away from home that is not intended for
them to play with.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Children should be made to understand
that they must not ask too many questions
promiscuously, such as, “Where are you
going?” “What have you there?” etc.</p>

<p>A child should be taught never to tease
a playmate’s mother, or to have its own
mother teased by a playmate. Teasing
should not be allowed.</p>

<p>Children should never be allowed to say
“I won’t” and “I will,” even to each
other.</p>

<p>Children should never be allowed to speak
of an elder person by the last name without
the proper prefix. They should also be
taught, in addressing boys and girls, say,
sixteen years of age, to use the prefix, as
“Miss” or “Mr.,” before the given name;
thus “Miss Alice” or “Mr. George.” In
fact, all people should observe this rule in
addressing the young, except in case the
older person is very familiar with the
younger, or in case the latter is too young
to be so addressed.</p>

<p>Children are now taught to say, “Yes,
mamma,” “What, mamma?” “Thank you,
mamma,” “Yes, Mrs. Allen,” “What,
Mrs. Allen?” etc., in preference to “Yes,
ma’am,” “No, ma’am,” etc.</p>

<p>Children should be taught that it is rude
to yawn without trying to suppress it, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
without concealing the mouth with the hand;
to whistle or hum in the presence of older
persons; or to make any monotonous noise
with feet or hands, beating time, etc.; to
play with napkin rings, or any article at
table during meal time; to pick the teeth
with the fingers; to trim or clean one’s nails
outside one’s room; to lounge anywhere in
the presence of company; to place the elbows
on the table, or to lean upon it while
eating; to speak of absent persons by their
first names, when they would not so address
them if they were present; to acquire the
habit of saying “you know,” “says he,”
“says she;” to use slang words; to tattle; to
hide the mouth with the hand when speaking;
to point at anyone or anything with
the finger; to stare at persons; to laugh at
one’s own stories or remarks; to toss
articles instead of handing them; to
leave the table with food in the mouth; to
take possession of a seat that belongs to
another without instantly rising upon his
return; to leave anyone without saying
“good-by;” to interrupt any one in conversation;
to push; to ridicule others; to pass,
without speaking, any one whom they know;
etc.</p>

<p>Some young people are not as particular
as they should be about certain articles of
the toilet, such as combs, brushes, etc. One
should always have such things for his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
individual use. It is exceedingly impolite
to use any toilet article belonging to another.</p>

<p>It is ill-mannered to ask questions about
affairs that do not concern one, or to pry
into the private affairs of one’s friends. To
inquire the cost of articles indiscriminately,
is impudent.</p>

<p>If parents are not at home when visitors
come in, or are too busy to see them at once,
a child, in the absence of a maid, should
politely show them in, offer them a comfortable
chair, show them anything he
thinks they will be interested in, and make
every effort to entertain them agreeably
until such time as his parents can take his
place. He should then politely withdraw
from the room.</p>

<p>Children and young people should early
learn not to monopolize the best light or
the most desirable seat in the room, but to
look about when anyone enters, whether a
guest or an older member of their own family,
and see if by giving up their own place
the new-comer may be made more comfortable.</p>

<p>A boy ought to show to his mother and
sisters every attention he would show to any
other woman. Should they chance to meet
on the street he should politely raise his
hat. He should allow them to pass first
through a door, give them the inside of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
walk, help them into a carriage, and everywhere
and under all circumstances treat
them with politeness and deference. Girls
should of course treat their brothers in the
same polite manner; for they can hardly
expect to receive attentions where they are
unwilling to bestow them.</p>

<p>Children, especially little boys, should be
taught not to precede their mothers, or any
woman, into theaters, street cars, churches,
elevators, or into the house or even a room.</p>


<h3>SCHOOL-ROOM ETIQUETTE.</h3>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>“Good manners are the shadows of virtues, if not virtues
themselves.”</p></div>

<p>If teachers realized the inestimable
amount of good they might accomplish by
giving a little time and thought to the
manners of their pupils, surely they would
willingly give it. Those of their pupils
who have no proper training at home would
thus gain a knowledge which, in after life,
would prove a blessing. And such a course
acted upon by the teacher would be of
great assistance to the parents of those who
are well trained at home; for a large portion
of a child’s time is spent in school, and
under conditions that require such training.</p>

<p>Teachers must treat their scholars politely
if they expect polite treatment from
them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Every teacher should see that no pupil is
allowed to treat those of a lower station in
life with disrespect.</p>

<p>It is a common occurrence for a teacher
to speak with seeming disrespect of a
pupil’s parents, blaming them for the
pupil’s lack of interest in school, truancy,
etc. Such a course is highly reprehensible
in the teacher, and gains the pupil’s ill-will.
It is better to assume that the parents
would be displeased with anything wrong
in the pupil, and to appeal to the pupil for
his mother’s or father’s sake.</p>

<p>A teacher should never allow herself or
himself to be addressed by pupils as “Teacher,”
but as Miss or Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>If pupils would take pains to bid a teacher
“good-morning” and “good-night,” they
would appear well in so doing, and easily
give pleasure to another.</p>

<p>The entire atmosphere of a school-room is
dependent upon trifles. Where a teacher, by
her own actions and in accordance with her
requirements, insures kindness and politeness
from all to all, she may feel almost sure
of the success of her school.</p>

<p>Young misses ought to be addressed by
the teacher as “Miss Julia,” “Miss Annie.”
Young boys (too young to be addressed as
Mr.) should be addressed as “Master
Brown,” “Master Jones,” etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Teachers should use great discretion in
reproving any unintentional rudeness, especially
on the part of those ignorant from
lack of home training. If such were reproved
gently and privately, it would be
more efficacious and just. No one should
be allowed to appear to disadvantage from
ignorance.</p>

<p>Selfishness, untruthfulness, slang, rowdyism,
egotism, or any show of superiority
should be corrected in the school-room.</p>

<p>Young teachers hardly realize with what
fear and dread mothers intrust to them their
carefully reared children, especially young
ones.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“Good fashion rests on realty, and hates
nothing so much as pretenders.”—<i>Emerson.</i></p></div>


<p>All presentations to foreign courts are
made through the national representatives,
and from them is received all the information
desired in reference to the necessary
forms and ceremonies.</p>

<p>Kings and queens are addressed as “Your
Majesty.” The Prince of Wales, the crown
princes, and all other princes and princesses
are addressed as “Your Royal Highness.”</p>

<p>The President’s “levees” at Washington
are open to all, and are conducted very much
as an ordinary “reception.” As one enters,
an official announces him, and he proceeds
directly to the president and his lady, and
pays his respects.</p>

<p>The door of the White House may be
said never to be closed, and any one who
desires may call upon its occupants as upon
those of any other dwelling. He may not,
however, obtain a personal interview. This,
to be secured, he must seek in the company
of an official or intimate friend of the president,
who will be able to judge of the claims
for attention of a visitor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>No particular style of dress is required to
make one’s appearance at the Republican
Court.</p>

<p>No refreshments are expected to be offered
at a presidential reception.</p>

<p>Custom does not require that the wife of
the president of the United States should return
official calls. Exception is made in the
case of visiting Royalty. The wives of the
foreign ambassadors should make the first
call upon the wife of the vice-president, as
should the wives of the cabinet officials. At
a function given by officials of foreign governments
at Washington, the wife of the
secretary of state takes precedence over the
wives of the foreign ambassadors.</p>

<h3>CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

<h4>BUSINESS CORRESPONDENCE.</h4>

<p>Closely written postal cards and long
letters meet with little favor among business
men; therefore it is important to make business
correspondence as plain and brief as
possible.</p>

<p>Names of places and persons should be
written very plainly.</p>

<p>When a letter is written in reply to another,
the date of the letter to which the
reply is made should be given, and it is an
excellent plan, and one that saves much
time, to give in a letter the substance of
the one to which it is a reply. This is
especially desirable when accepting a special
offer made in such letter, thus:</p>

<p>When writing a business letter, a married
woman should sign her name as she would
sign it when writing any other letter; that
is, by placing her first name and surname in
the usual position of the signature, and adding,
a little to the left-hand, her name in
full, with the address, thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>When writing to a person or firm for information
solely for one’s own benefit, a
postal card or a stamped envelope should
be enclosed for a reply.</p>

<p>It is a too common custom among people
unacquainted with the rules of business,
when sending an order to one firm, to enclose
money to be paid another, or with
which to make small purchases in some other
line, to be sent in the package ordered from
the firm with which the correspondence is
held. The proper way to do when one
wishes to order goods from different houses
in the same city, and yet have all the goods
shipped in the same package, is to write an
order to each firm requesting the goods
to be delivered to the firm with which one
does the most business, having, of course,
notified such firm of his action.</p>

<p>It has become so common among people
to request everything “by return mail” that
business men look upon such requests as a
mere form, rather than as an evidence of
urgency. If such urgency exists, it is well
to state the cause of it in a few words, and
request immediate attention to the order,
thus:</p>

<p>Whoever writes a caustic letter makes a
mistake; for it will do no good, even if there
seems to be a cause for it, and if the assumed
cause proves to be simply a mistake the
writer will be humiliated.</p>


<h4>LETTERS OF APPLICATION.</h4>

<p>It is sometimes difficult to write a letter
of application, because one must speak of
himself and of his ability to fill the position
sought, and to do so without seeming
egotistic. If the applicant has had experience
in work similar to that for which he
applies, a simple statement of the fact, the
length of time engaged in such work, the
reason for quitting his last position, and the
name and address of his former employer,
should form the substance of his letter. If
he has had no experience, he should state
what advantages he has had to qualify himself
for the work, and not boast that he
could soon and easily learn to do it.</p>

<p>The following will exemplify the points:</p>

<i>Gentlemen:</i>

<p>I am informed by a friend, Mr. C. A.
Brooks, of your village, that you are in want of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
book-keeper, and I desire to make application for
the position. I am a young man, but have had
several years experience in keeping books. I am
now in charge of the books of Messrs. Jones &amp;
Williams, of this city, to whom I can refer you for
information as to my ability and character. I desire
to go to the country, and should be glad to
work for you, if you can pay me $70 per month,
which is my present salary.</p>

<i>Gentlemen:</i><br />

<p>I am informed that your shipping clerk is
soon to leave, and that the position now held by
him will be vacant. I desire to apply for the
same, but I am sorry to state that I have not had
any experience in this particular line of work;
however, I have been a general clerk in a village
store, and am familiar with simple book-keeping,
which would probably enable me to learn the
work of a shipping clerk in a reasonable length of
time.</p>

<p>In case you should wish to engage me on
trial, I would gladly assist, without compensation,
your present clerk until the end of his engagement,
which, I understand, is about three weeks
from date.</p>

<p>My present employer is Mr. G. W. Webster,
of this place, and he will doubtless answer any inquiries
concerning my work that you may address
him.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Respectfully,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Geo. E. Johnson</span>.<br />
</p></div>

<p>Such letters should always contain a
stamp for a reply. The stamp is attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
by its corner or by a pin to the head of the
letter.</p>

<p>Great precaution should always be taken
not to send a letter with insufficient postage
on it; for the additional postage is collected
from the person to whom the letter is sent,
and many business men look upon such
neglect as inexcusable, if they do not consider
it dishonest, inasmuch as it compels
others to pay what the writer should have
known it was his duty to pay.</p>

<p>An application for a position as teacher in
a public school is often very difficult to
write, because it is necessary to say much,
and to say it, in some cases, to men who
are not thoroughly familiar with business
principles.</p>

<p>Before giving any forms, some suggestions
which experience has taught may be
of great importance. The handwriting
should be natural. If one has a degree, he
should not sign his name with it, but state
in his letter that he is a graduate, naming
the institution from which he was graduated.
All boasting should be avoided.
One should not ask a reply by return mail,
but he might enclose a postal card or a
stamp with a request to be informed when
the board meets to consider applications.
One ought not to name as references persons
who know nothing about his work; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
although they may, if consulted, endeavor
to praise him, they will show their ignorance
of what he has done, and the board
will naturally assume that he has no better
references.</p>

<p>As a rule it is not advisable to give testimonials
from ministers or from county
superintendents, unless the writers can say
that they are familiar with the teacher’s
work, and have visited his school. Very
old testimonials should not be placed before
a board. Indeed, it is doubtful whether
any testimonial, unless it comes from a
competent judge, is of value.</p>

<p>If boards would consult one’s references,
or seek information from outside sources, it
would be only just to all concerned; but as
they will not often do this, it is wise to
send copies of two or three, generally not
more, good testimonials, and to have one
or two of the applicant’s friends write the
board in his behalf.</p>

<p>A letter of application, especially if for
the position of superintendent or that of
principal, should be full and explicit, specifying
the opportunities the writer has had
to prepare himself for the position, rather
than stating that he has done so-and-so, for
in the latter case it might seem like boasting.</p>

<p>Sometimes a short letter, unless circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
demand a long one, will be most favorably
received by a board. The writer
once knew a very important position to be
obtained by a correspondence about as follows
(names of places, dates, etc., are omitted):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<span class="smcap">To the Honorable Board of Education.</span><br />

<i>Gentlemen:</i>

<p>I learn through a friend in your county, that
the position of superintendent of your school is vacant.
If the position has not been filled, I desire
to make application for the same. I am a graduate
of ——————, and have taught three years.
I am now principal of the —————— schools, but
desire to teach in your State, as my home is there.</p>

<div class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Respectfully,</span><br />
——————<br />
</div></div>

<p>A stamp was enclosed for a reply. The
secretary of the board at once wrote asking
for references and stating the salary paid.
The applicant replied that he did not wish
the position at the salary named, and
thanked the secretary for the trouble he had
been given.</p>

<p>Had the applicant written a long letter,
setting forth the value of his services, and
urging the board to raise the salary, it is
not probable that a reply would have been
received by him. The simple statement
that he did not want the position at the salary
named, was evidence to the board that
he considered his services worth more, and,
moreover, that he had confidence that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
would command more. The secretary replied
to the last short note, asking for references
and at what salary he would accept
the position. The information was
given, and in a few days the applicant was
requested to meet the board with the assurance
that the position would be given him
if the interview proved satisfactory, which
it did. Afterwards the applicant was informed
by the president of the board that
his short business-like letters, written in an
almost illegible but natural hand, obtained
for him the place over nearly one hundred
applicants, many of whom were college
graduates of long experience in teaching,
and who had basketfuls of testimonials, but
not one of whom had written even a fairly
good letter of application.</p>

<p>Many cities and towns have stated public
examinations, which applicants must attend
before they can be employed.</p>

<p>The impression of character and of qualification
produced by a personal interview
is deemed so important that even minor appointments
are scarcely given to any one
not personally known to one of the school
board, or to some one in whose professional
judgment they have great confidence.</p>

<p>Preliminary inquiries about positions are
most profitably made through acquaintances,
who can advise one whether to take any
further steps. One might write as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<i>My Dear Friend:</i>

<p>May I trouble you to ascertain whether there
is any vacancy in the schools at Elgin, to which I
would have any prospect of an appointment? You
will confer a great favor upon me if you will ask the
superintendent, and let me know soon what he
says. You can say to him that after I finished the
high school course at Racine, I taught a term in a
district school in Racine County, Wis., and was one
year in charge of a primary department at Woodstock,
and that I had charge of the grammar department
at the latter place last year.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>GENERAL HINTS.</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>We remain shackled by timidity till we have
learned to speak and act with propriety.—<i>Samuel
Johnson.</i></p></div>


<p>A man raises his hat when walking with
another, not only to his own acquaintances,
but to those persons who bow to his companion,
whether he is acquainted with them
or not.</p>

<p>If a man meets a woman in a hotel corridor
or hall he should step aside, allowing
her to pass, and raising his hat.</p>

<p>If in a public place a man hands a woman
anything she has dropped, he should raise
his hat when offering it to her. A well-bred
man raises his hat after passing the
fare of a woman in a car or coach. This
does not mean that he has any desire to
become acquainted with her, but it is his
tribute to her sex.</p>

<p>Slight inaccuracies in statements should
not be corrected in the presence of others.</p>

<p>One should give her children, unless
married, their Christian names only, or say
“my daughter” or “my son,” in speaking
of them to anyone excepting servants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Men remove their hats when in elevators
in the presence of women.</p>

<p>Men having occasion to pass before women
seated in lecture and concert rooms, and all
other places, should “beg pardon,” and
pass with their faces, and not their backs,
toward them.</p>

<p>In going up or down stairs, a man precedes
a woman or walks by her side.</p>

<p>To indulge in ridicule of another, whether
the subject be present or absent, is to descend
below the level of gentlemanly propriety.</p>

<p>A reverence for religious observances and
religious opinions is a distinguishing trait
of a refined mind.</p>

<p>Religious topics should be avoided in conversation,
except where all are prepared to
concur in a respectful treatment of the subject.
In mixed societies the subject should
never be introduced.</p>

<p>Frequent consultation of the watch or
time-piece is impolite, either when at home or
abroad. If at home, it appears as if one
were tired of the company and wished them
to be gone; if abroad, as if the hours dragged
heavily, and one were calculating how soon
he would be released.</p>

<p>It is very unbecoming to exhibit petulance
or angry feeling, though it is indulged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in largely in almost every circle. The true
gentleman does not suffer his countenance
to be easily ruffled.</p>

<p>The right of privacy is sacred, and should
always be respected. It is exceedingly improper
to enter a private room without
knocking. No relation, however intimate,
will justify an abrupt intrusion upon
a private apartment. Likewise the trunk,
boxes, packets, papers, or letters of any individual,
locked or unlocked, sealed or unsealed,
are sacred. It is ill-mannered even
to open a book-case, or to read a written
paper lying open, without permission, expressed
or implied.</p>

<p>Members of the same family should never
differ with each other in public.</p>

<p>One should never appear to be thinking
of his own personal rights to the resenting
of a little slight, whether real or imaginary.</p>

<p>In small communities where near neighbors,
for convenience’s sake, borrow back and
forth, great care should be taken that the
practice does not become a nuisance, as it
surely does when it is indulged in too frequently,
and when borrowed articles are
not speedily returned and in good condition.
There should be no stinted measures
in returning.</p>

<p>Ostentation is snobbish, as is all too great
profusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>To affect not to remember a person is
despicable, and reflects only on the pretender.</p>

<p>Some conceited or ill-bred people imagine
they make themselves important and powerful
by being rude and insulting.</p>

<p>One is judged, to a great extent, by the
character of his associates.</p>

<p>One should be very careful how he asks
for the loan of a book. If interest is shown
in one, its owner will offer it for perusal if
willing to lend it. When reading a borrowed
book, one should take the best of
care of it, and return it as soon as possible.
No real lady or gentlemen will leave finger
prints upon its pages, or turn down its
leaves in place of a book-mark, or scribble
in it with a pencil, or loan it to a third person
without the knowledge and consent of
the owner.</p>

<p>A lack of reverence in one in the house of
God, implies low parentage, or a coarse nature
that is not subject to refinement.</p>

<p>To whisper and laugh during any public
entertainment proclaims one’s ill-breeding,
and invades the rights of others.</p>

<p>One ought never to leave the house after
the evening’s entertainment without bidding
the hostess good-night, and acknowledging
the pleasure the evening has afforded him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The business man has no stock-in-trade
that pays him better than a good address.</p>

<p>It is only those persons and families
whose position is not a secure one, that are
afraid to be seen outside their own social
circle.</p>

<p>One should never reprove servants or
children before strangers.</p>

<p>A true lady will not betray her astonishment
at any violation of conventional rules,
least of all will she make it her province to
punish those who may make any such violation.</p>

<p>If one, on meeting another, fails to recall
the name, he should frankly say so.</p>

<p>One should never recall himself to the
recollection of a casual acquaintance without
at the same time mentioning his name.</p>

<p>In a flat-house a man should take his hat
and coat into the apartment where he is going
to call, and not leave them in the hall
on the first floor.</p>

<p>It is very bad taste, even in quite a large
party, for young girls to visit a man at his
office.</p>

<p>It is perfectly good form for a mother
to invite to a little child’s party children
whose parents she does not know, or who
have not yet called upon her. The invitations
go out in the child’s name and to the
child’s friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>It is extremely rude and ill-bred, when at
a boarding-house or hotel table, to criticise
the food that is served. The fact that it is
paid for makes it none the less an evidence
of bad manners. People who are not satisfied
where they are boarding should always
leave; they have no right to make others
uncomfortable by their lack of good-breeding.</p>

<p>Women of good-breeding do not permit
themselves to “overlook” those to whom
courtesies are due.</p>

<p>A man should learn to put his coat on in
a public place of entertainment so that he
will not require assistance from the woman
who is with him.</p>

<p>The young woman to whom a seat is offered
should take it, unless her companion
is an older woman, when it would be quite
proper to extend the courtesy to her.</p>

<p>It is very bad taste, even for a frolic, for
a young girl to assume boy’s clothes, or get
herself up in any way that will tend to make
herself look masculine.</p>

<p>There is no impropriety in giving to those
men friends with whom one is well acquainted,
some trifling souvenir at Christmas or
Easter, or on birthdays.</p>

<p>It is customary for a young man to send
a young woman only such gifts as flowers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
candy, and books; and as these presents are
sent merely as a slight return for her hospitality
and invitations to her house, etc., it is
not necessary for her to send him any gift
in return. If, however, a young woman
and man are on intimate enough terms to
exchange presents, she may send him any
small article for the desk or toilet; such as
a silver-handled whisk broom, court-plaster
case, pen-wiper, paper-cutter, or books,
which are a good present and always acceptable
to any one.</p>

<p>Nothing looks more ill-bred than to see a
young man, under his parents’ roof, devoting
himself during a whole evening entirely
to one young woman to the ignoring of the
others.</p>

<p>A man who is escorting two women in
the street should not walk between them,
but on the outside of both near the curb; at
the theater or at any place of amusement or
at church, he should sit nearest to the aisle,
at the side of one of them.</p>

<p>Unless there is some good reason why she
needs his support, a man seldom offers his
arm to a woman he escorts, even in the
evening. A husband may offer his arm to
his wife, of course, and a man may proffer
this help to an invalid or aged person.</p>

<p>A little delicate perfume may be used with
propriety, but a heavy perfume, and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
that scents the entire room in which the
person who uses it happens to be, is in very
bad form.</p>

<p>In opening a door from the hall to the
drawing-room, a man should hold it while
a woman precedes him in entering.</p>

<p>When one’s pardon is asked for some
slight inattention, an inclination of the
head and a smile is the best answer.</p>

<p>The words “gentleman friend” and
“lady friend” have been so vulgarized that
most well-bred women now say “man
friend” or “woman friend,” it being taken
for granted that they number among their
friends only ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>Custom never condones liberties, no matter
how slight, between young men and
women.</p>

<p>When a woman is visiting, any acquaintance
who should call upon her should also
ask for her hostess, and if she is absent
leave a card for her.</p>

<p>It is considered very bad taste for a
young girl to address a man with whom
her acquaintance is but slight by his Christian
name.</p>

<p>No young man has any right to spend
the entire afternoon and evening every
Sunday at one particular house, to the annoyance
of an entire family, who do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
like to make him conscious of the fact that
they consider him a bore.</p>

<p>When a young man is paying a visit,
and the older members of the family are in
the room, he should, in leaving, bid them
good-night first, and afterward say his farewell
to the young girl on whom he has
called. It is in bad taste for her to go any
further than the parlor door with him.</p>

<p>Even if a correspondence is of a “purely
friendly character,” it should not exist between
a married woman and a young man,
or between a married man and a young
woman.</p>

<p>It is not good taste to ask one’s men
friends to buy tickets for charity affairs.
They do not like to refuse, and very often,
though the sum required may be small,
they cannot afford it.</p>

<p>There is very great harm in young girls
meeting young men in secret; the men will
have no respect for the girls, and nothing
but mortification for the girls will be the
result.</p>

<p>It is quite proper to thank any public
servant, such as a railroad conductor, for
any information he may give, but it is not
necessary to be effusive about it.</p>

<p>It is not in good taste, nor even proper,
for young women to go alone to a hotel to
dine with a man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>When a girl is young and pretty, a Platonic
friendship is very difficult to keep up.</p>

<p>When a man friend has driven a woman
in town to go to church he should take her
direct to the church and leave her there
while he drives where his carriage and
horses are to wait until after the service. Of
course he would walk to church and join
her there.</p>

<p>It is not in good taste for different members
of a party to go off in pairs, and spend
the evening alone on the seashore.</p>

<p>It is not wise for a young woman and
young man living in the same city to correspond.
If meeting each other often they
ought to be able to say all that is necessary.</p>

<p>One has no right whatever to read a postal
card addressed to another without permission.</p>

<p>The very minute the married man begins
to tell of his wife’s faults, the time has come
to cut his acquaintance.</p>

<p>It is more than wrong for a young girl to
receive visits from a married man.</p>

<p>In entering any public place a woman
should precede a man, but going down the
aisle, the usher, of course, would precede
her.</p>

<p>A hostess stands to receive her visitors,
but she does not advance to meet them unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the visitor should be some one quite old or
of such importance that the visit is of great
honor. The hostess extends her hand to
the men who call, as well as to the women.</p>

<p>A woman is not supposed to recognize a
man who is one of a group standing in a
public place, since a modest girl will not
look close enough at a group of men to
recognize an acquaintance.</p>

<p>No matter how well a woman may know
a man, it would be in very bad form to send
him an invitation which does not include
his wife, unless it should be at some affair
at which only men are to be present.</p>

<p>A man should show as much courtesy to
a woman in his employ as he does to the
women he meets in social life.</p>

<p>It is not in good taste to visit at the home
of one’s betrothed, unless a personal invitation
is received from his mother.</p>

<p>Two women may attend, with perfect
propriety, a place of amusement without an
escort. They should be, however, under
such circumstances, exceptionally quiet in
their manners and their dress.</p>

<p>In escorting a young woman home, a man
should go up the steps with her, wait until
the door is opened, and, as she enters the
house, raise his hat and say good-night.</p>

<p>If a young girl were very ill, there would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
be no impropriety in her mother bringing her
betrothed to see her, although, of course,
she would remain in the room during his
visit.</p>

<p>It is always proper and courteous for a person
in church to share either prayer-book
or hymnal with anyone who may be without
either.</p>

<p>There is no impropriety in a woman’s
permitting a man friend to assist her in
putting on her over-shoes.</p>

<p>If one approves of the acting or the sentiment
of the play, there is no impropriety in
expressing gentle applause, but a loud
clapping of the hands is decidedly vulgar.</p>

<p>One should never prevent people from
leaving his house when they desire. That
is not hospitality. It is tyranny; it is taking
a mean advantage of their unwillingness
to offend.</p>

<p>If a women lives in a boarding house and
has only one room, it would be very bad taste
to receive any man visitor there. Even if
it is not quite so agreeable, they should be
received in the public parlor.</p>

<p>When a man and woman approach a
hostess together, the hostess should shake
hands with the woman first.</p>

<p>When a man calls on a woman, he shakes
hands with her on his arrival; but, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
he is very intimate in the house, a simple
bow is sufficient when he leaves.</p>

<p>An unmarried woman writing her name
in a hotel register should prefix it with
“Miss” in parentheses.</p>

<p>When a man friend has taken a lady to
a concert, she should thank him for his
kindness in having given her a pleasant
evening.</p>

<p>It is not advisable for a girl to deliberately
“cut” any man. If she wishes to discontinue
her acquaintance with a man whom
she cannot respect, it may be done gradually,
at first by the coolest of greetings;
then, by a look in the other direction; and
in time all recognition will cease.</p>

<p>If a stranger takes occasion to be polite
to one during a street-car accident, all that
is necessary is a polite “thank you.”</p>

<p>When a man who is to escort a girl to an
entertainment calls for her at her own
home, it is proper for her to appear with
her wraps on, and be ready to start at once.</p>

<p>If a man is courteous enough to open the
door of a store or any public building for a
woman, she should thank him.</p>

<p>If a girl of sixteen goes to an evening affair,
her mother should arrange to have
either a servant or a member of the family
go after her to bring her home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>If the hostess opens the door for a man
caller, she should precede him in entering
the parlor.</p>

<p>After having taken a meal or having received
any other kind of entertainment at a
private house, before leaving a guest
should express his thanks, or, rather his
enjoyment, of the same to the hostess.
This courtesy from a young man or girl is
very acceptable to elderly ladies.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria has forgiven certain
breaches of etiquette made in ignorance,
and left her guest to discover the mistake
at another time. It is a reprehensible host
indeed who does otherwise, and so makes a
guest uncomfortable. Etiquette is all
wrong and false when it makes one forget
the higher laws of courtesy or hospitality.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
